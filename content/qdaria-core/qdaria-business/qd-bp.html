<section id="executive-summary">
<h2>Executive Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>QDaria is an early-stage <strong>quantum computing and AI</strong> startup based in Norway, founded with the bold vision of building the world’s first <strong>fault-tolerant topological quantum computer</strong> using exotic <strong>Fibonacci anyons</strong>. In collaboration with Rigetti Computing, QDaria aims to deploy Norway’s first quantum processing unit (the <strong>Novera QPU</strong>) as a stepping stone toward this topological quantum computer breakthrough. Our mission is to revolutionize industries – from cybersecurity and finance to healthcare and education – by fusing <strong>quantum computing</strong> with <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p>We are developing a suite of <strong>seven venture-ready technologies</strong> under the QDaria umbrella, alongside a unique quantum hardware-access service. These include quantum-resistant cybersecurity (<strong>Zipminator</strong>), a quantum fintech platform (<strong>Qm9</strong>), an AI-driven education and governance system (<strong>QDiana</strong>, which originated from an “AGI Politician” concept), a quantum-augmented HPC engine for fluid dynamics (<strong>QMikeAI</strong>), a quantum health-tech platform (<strong>QNilaya</strong>), a quantum-natural language model (<strong>TeHaA</strong>), and a quantum robotics platform (<strong>Damon</strong>). Each product targets a high-impact market niche, while collectively they create a synergistic ecosystem of hardware, software, and AI. In the long term, QDaria will evolve into <strong>QDaria Holdings</strong>, spinning off each major product as an independent subsidiary positioned for its own growth and <strong>IPO by 2028–2030</strong>.</p>
<p>The timing is ideal. The global quantum computing industry is on the cusp of explosive growth, projected to create nearly $1 trillion in economic value by 2035. Today the market remains nascent (estimated at only ~$1–2 billion in 2024), but it is expected to expand to $5–7 billion by 2029 as early commercial applications emerge.</p>
<p>At the same time, artificial intelligence is injecting trillions into the economy – up to $13 trillion by 2030 according to McKinsey – and creating unprecedented demand for computational power. QDaria sits at the intersection of these trends, combining <strong>quantum computing + AI (Q+AI)</strong> to tackle problems beyond the reach of classical systems.</p>
<p>Governments worldwide have pledged over $30 billion to quantum R&amp;D, and private investors poured a record $1.5+ billion in 2024 into quantum startups. This rising tide underscores an <strong>unprecedented opportunity</strong> for new entrants. QDaria’s agile startup approach and unique blend of offerings enable us to move quickly in this fast-evolving landscape.</p>
<p>We have already gained significant traction and validation. QDaria was recently recognized among the <strong>top 5 startups in Europe</strong> and <strong>top 25 globally</strong>, earning our CEO a keynote invitation to <strong>Davos Innovation Week 2025</strong>. We are also candidates to host major quantum conferences (e.g. IQT Nordics 2026 in Oslo). These honors reflect the excitement around QDaria’s mission and the credibility of our team.</p>
<p>QDaria is currently raising a $12M seed round to fuel our next phase of growth. The funding will support key hardware acquisition (a dilution refrigerator for our quantum lab), hiring of world-class quantum engineers and AI researchers, and product development through initial MVP launches. With this seed capital, we will establish Norway’s first quantum computing facility in partnership with Rigetti, accelerate our software and AI platform development, and lay the groundwork for scaling each product line. We present in this plan a detailed roadmap translating the $12M investment into tangible milestones: delivering early products, achieving technical breakthroughs, and preparing each venture for market entry and future financing. By executing on our strategy, QDaria will create a <strong>portfolio of quantum and AI companies</strong>, each with the potential for significant standalone value, while advancing toward our ultimate vision of a topologically-powered quantum future.</p>

<section id="market-analysis">
<h2>Market Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#market-analysis" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The markets QDaria operates in – <strong>Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Synthetic Biology,</strong> and their convergence – each show enormous growth potential. Below we analyze these domains and the economic opportunities they present:</p>
<section id="quantum-computing-industry-outlook">
<h3>Quantum Computing: Industry Outlook<a class="headerlink" href="#quantum-computing-industry-outlook" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Quantum computing is transitioning from pure research to early commercial use, driving significant optimism about its future market. In 2024, the <strong>global quantum computing market size</strong> (revenue) is roughly $1.3 billion. This figure is expected to grow to about $5–6 billion by 2029 (a &gt;30% CAGR) as more organizations begin experimenting with quantum algorithms for optimization, simulation, and machine learning tasks. The <strong>long-term outlook</strong> is even more striking: McKinsey estimates quantum technologies could account for nearly $1.3 trillion in value by 2035, and other analysts project on the order of $1 trillion in cumulative economic impact by 2035. This value reflects quantum computing’s potential to revolutionize industries from finance to pharmaceuticals by solving complex problems far beyond the reach of classical computers.</p>
<p>Several factors are fueling this growth in quantum computing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Technical Progress:</strong> Qubit counts and quality are improving. Industry leaders like IBM have 433-qubit processors available today and roadmap targets for 1000+ qubits in the next couple of years. Error rates are gradually decreasing, enabling longer and more complex circuits to run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heavy Investment:</strong> Governments worldwide have collectively pledged over $30 billion in quantum research funding, recognizing the technology’s strategic importance. China, the EU, the U.S., and others are investing in national quantum programs. Private investment is also surging – quantum startups raised ~$1.4B in 2022 and &gt;$1.5B in 2024, a trend bolstered by the hype around AI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ecosystem Development:</strong> A growing ecosystem of software tools (e.g. Qiskit, Cirq) and cloud platforms (AWS Braket, Azure Quantum, IBM Quantum) is lowering barriers to entry for developers and companies. “Quantum-as-a-Service” offerings let users access quantum hardware over the cloud without owning a device, expanding the user base and training a generation of quantum programmers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Use Cases:</strong> Initial commercial use cases are emerging in areas like cryptography (post-quantum encryption), chemistry/material science (quantum simulation for drug discovery or material design), and optimization (supply chain, scheduling). These early successes, albeit often on small problem instances, are validating the real-world relevance of quantum algorithms and spurring further adoption efforts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate the anticipated growth trend, the chart below shows the <strong>projected economic impact</strong> of quantum computing over the next 10+ years:</p>
<div id="marketGrowthChart" class="chart-placeholder"></div>
<p><em>(Chart: Projected Global Quantum Computing Market Impact 2020–2035, showing an inflection to ~$1T+ by 2035. Source: McKinsey, The Quantum Insider.)</em></p>
<p>While forecasts vary, the trajectory points sharply upward. By the early 2030s, quantum computing’s impact could be <strong>transformative</strong>, potentially approaching <strong>trillions of dollars</strong> in value creation. This rising tide creates a significant opportunity for innovative companies like QDaria to emerge and capture value, especially by addressing unmet needs in the ecosystem (such as talent shortage, software tools, and integration of quantum with AI). Our strategy is timed to ride this wave: establish a foothold in today’s niche market, scale alongside the industry’s growth, and be a frontrunner when quantum computing hits mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>That said, we recognize the inherent uncertainty in timing. Quantum computing is a disruptive technology with a wide range of outcomes – rapid breakthroughs could accelerate adoption, while technical hurdles (e.g. error correction) could slow progress. We have contingency plans for multiple scenarios (from conservative to optimistic), ensuring QDaria remains adaptable whether the inflection point arrives in 5 years or 15 years.</p>

<section id="artificial-intelligence-economic-potential">
<h3>Artificial Intelligence: Economic Potential<a class="headerlink" href="#artificial-intelligence-economic-potential" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If quantum computing is the rocket, <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is the fuel currently propelling tech innovation. AI is a much larger and more mature market today, and it forms the “demand pull” for advanced computing that quantum can supply. According to McKinsey Global Institute, AI could add an <em>additional</em> $13 trillion to global economic output by 2030 – roughly a 1.2% boost to annual GDP growth worldwide. Tractica estimated the global AI software market reached ~$50 billion in 2020 and is growing ~40% CAGR, on track to several hundred billion by the late 2020s. The excitement around <strong>Generative AI</strong> in 2023–2024 (with products like GPT-4, DALL-E, etc.) has only accelerated investment and adoption across industries.</p>
<p>Key trends in AI relevant to QDaria include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Soaring Compute Needs:</strong> Cutting-edge AI models (like large language models and deep neural networks) require immense computational resources. Training GPT-3, for instance, took thousands of petaflop/s-days of compute. This need for compute is outpacing Moore’s Law, creating a search for new hardware paradigms – including quantum – to sustain AI’s progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI in Every Industry:</strong> AI is being applied in healthcare (diagnostics, drug discovery), finance (trading algorithms, risk modeling), education (personalized learning), government (policy modeling, smart cities), and beyond. This aligns with QDaria’s targeted sectors. There is particular interest in AI for <strong>scientific discovery</strong> (e.g., AI + quantum simulation for material science), which resonates with our quantum/synthetic biology efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autonomous Agents:</strong> Beyond traditional machine learning, there’s a push toward more <strong>agentic AI</strong> – systems that can make plans, take actions, and interact in feedback loops (e.g. autonomous trading agents, AI tutors, or even AI “politicians”). QDaria’s products like QDiana and QMikeAI are examples of this trend, embedding domain expertise (quantum algorithms) into AI agents for decision-making. The market for such agents could evolve as an extension of the AI software market, offering higher-level automation to enterprises.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For QDaria, AI is both an enabling technology (we use AI in our products and research) and a market in itself (some of our products <em>are</em> AI systems). By 2030, AI will likely be ubiquitous in enterprise software. Our differentiation comes from infusing <strong>quantum capabilities</strong> into AI systems – either to <strong>supercharge AI</strong> (achieve faster or better results with quantum hardware) or to <strong>manage quantum complexity</strong> (AI that helps users leverage quantum computing). This fusion of AI and quantum gives us a cutting-edge positioning that pure-play AI companies lack.</p>
</section>
<section id="synthetic-biology-and-quantum-enhanced-biotech">
<h3>Synthetic Biology and Quantum-Enhanced BioTech<a class="headerlink" href="#synthetic-biology-and-quantum-enhanced-biotech" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Another pillar of QDaria’s interdisciplinary approach is <strong>synthetic biology</strong> and quantum applications in biology. Synthetic biology – the design and engineering of biological systems – is a rapidly growing field, projected to reach $60–80 billion in global market size by 2030 (from ~$15–20B in 2024) with ~20–25% CAGR. Breakthroughs in gene editing (CRISPR), bio-manufacturing, and computational biology are driving this growth. QDaria’s interest in this space (via our planned QNilaya platform and a dedicated Quantum Biology R&amp;D division) is in leveraging quantum computing and AI to accelerate biotech innovation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Drug Discovery:</strong> Quantum computers can potentially simulate molecular interactions and protein folding much faster or more accurately than classical supercomputers, enabling faster discovery of drug candidates. QDaria’s QNilaya aims to use quantum algorithms for molecular modeling, combined with AI to sift through and optimize candidates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personalized Medicine:</strong> The integration of quantum computing in analyzing complex biological data (genomic, proteomic data, etc.) could unlock new insights for personalized treatment plans. While nascent, this is a long-term opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthetic Bio Design:</strong> Designing new materials or organisms (e.g. biofuels, engineered enzymes) often involves navigating huge combinatorial spaces – an area where quantum optimization algorithms might excel, guided by AI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The synthetic biology industry’s growth is fueled by the convergence of biology and IT; adding quantum tech into the mix is the next frontier. By positioning ourselves at this convergence (Quantum + AI + Bio), QDaria could tap into multi-billion dollar markets in pharma and biotech. It is an inherently high-risk, high-reward play – initially more research-focused – but even partial success (e.g., demonstrating a quantum-accelerated drug discovery pipeline) could attract major partnerships with pharmaceutical companies or government health agencies.</p>
</section>
<section id="convergence-of-quantum-and-ai-q-ai-integration">
<h3>Convergence of Quantum and AI (Q+AI Integration)<a class="headerlink" href="#convergence-of-quantum-and-ai-q-ai-integration" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The intersection of quantum computing and AI – <strong>Quantum AI</strong> – is an emerging niche that many believe could be <em>greater than the sum of its parts</em>. By using quantum processors to run or enhance AI algorithms, we might achieve leaps in capabilities (such as exponentially faster training for certain models, or new forms of AI that leverage quantum phenomena). Conversely, using AI to <strong>control</strong> quantum systems (for error correction, calibration, or algorithm design) can significantly improve quantum hardware performance. QDaria is investing in both sides of this synergy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Quantum-Enhanced AI:</strong> Our product <strong>TeHaA</strong> exemplifies this, aiming to be a quantum-enhanced large language model. Running portions of an AI model on a quantum backend (like Rigetti’s QPUs or future topological qubits) could allow exploration of extremely high-dimensional optimization landscapes more efficiently. This might improve learning speed or result quality for tasks like natural language understanding. While the field is nascent, market analyses foresee the <strong>Quantum AI market</strong> (tools specifically combining the two) reaching ~$1.8–2.0 billion by 2030 – a small but rapidly growing segment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI for Quantum:</strong> QDaria’s <strong>QDiana and QMikeAI</strong> agents represent using AI to make quantum tech more usable. By embedding expertise into AI assistants, we lower the barrier for businesses and developers to adopt quantum solutions. This could accelerate market adoption (addressing the talent gap issue) and set QDaria’s software apart through superior user experience.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The broader vision is that <strong>Quantum + AI + X</strong> (with X being domains like finance or biology) will yield the next wave of computing breakthroughs. We already see “Quantum Machine Learning” emerging in research, and companies like Google and IBM exploring how quantum can improve AI workflows. QDaria is one of the first startups explicitly focusing on this fusion. We expect that within 5–7 years, early commercial Quantum-AI applications will appear (for example, quantum-optimized neural networks for pattern recognition). When that happens, QDaria will be ready with proven solutions. Our bet is that by being early movers in Q+AI, we can claim thought leadership and establish IP in this crossover field, thus riding two exponential curves simultaneously (quantum’s and AI’s) rather than one.</p>
<p>To summarize the market landscape: <strong>Quantum computing</strong> is a high-growth emerging market (&lt;$2B today to ~$7B by 2030, with enormous long-term upside) that QDaria directly targets. <strong>AI</strong> is a much larger, more mature market (hundreds of billions today, trillions in impact) that provides immediate opportunities and a path to revenue for QDaria’s AI-centric products. <strong>Synthetic biology</strong> is an adjacent high-growth tech sector where our quantum+AI capabilities can differentiate us in the longer term. And the <strong>integration of quantum and AI</strong> is a unique niche where we aim to lead. This multi-pronged market approach diversifies our opportunity: success in any one of these domains could justify the business, while combined success yields a powerful, diversified tech conglomerate.</p>
<p>From an investor perspective, QDaria offers exposure to all these frontier tech themes in one package, with an agile strategy to pivot emphasis as needed based on market signals. Our plan is to remain <em>opportunity-driven</em>, allocating resources to the segments gaining the most traction (e.g., if quantum computing adoption is slower initially, we drive revenue through AI products and vice versa). This balanced approach maximizes our chances of capturing substantial value in the 2025–2035 timeframe.</p>

<section id="competitive-landscape">
<h2>Competitive Landscape<a class="headerlink" href="#competitive-landscape" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The current landscape spans tech giants, specialized startups, and academic labs, but <strong>QDaria occupies a unique niche</strong> at the intersection of hardware access, software, and AI. Below, we outline major competitor groups and how we differentiate:</p>
<p><strong>Tech Giants (IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel)</strong> – These large companies have major quantum R&amp;D programs. For example, IBM offers cloud access to superconducting quantum processors (with a 433-qubit system online and a 1121-qubit system planned in 2024) and has a full ecosystem (Qiskit). Google achieved a quantum supremacy milestone in 2019 on a 53-qubit device and is developing next-gen processors. Microsoft is pursuing topological qubits (similar to QDaria’s long-term goal) and integrates quantum into its Azure cloud platform. Amazon (AWS Braket) is aggregating offerings from various hardware providers. <strong>Strengths:</strong> virtually unlimited budgets, top talent, existing cloud and enterprise customer base. <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> bureaucratic, not focused on niche applications; primarily focused on hardware and cloud services, not on specialized vertical solutions or AI integration as QDaria is. <strong>QDaria’s stance:</strong> We view tech giants more as potential partners/enablers than direct competitors. For instance, QDaria can run our software on IBM or Azure hardware, or offer value-added solutions on top of their platforms. Our agility and vertical focus let us fill gaps too narrow for giants to address. Moreover, none of the big players currently offers the kind of <strong>agentic AI integration</strong> (QDiana, QMikeAI) or <strong>hands-on hardware kits</strong> that QDaria does, which sets us apart in user experience.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Quantum Hardware Startups (IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave, PsiQuantum, etc.)</strong> – A number of pure-play quantum computing companies have emerged, some now public via SPAC (IonQ, Rigetti, D-Wave) and others well-funded privately (PsiQuantum). <strong>IonQ</strong> uses trapped-ion qubits and went public in 2021 (currently offering ~29 algorithmic qubits with plans for 64 by 2025). <strong>Rigetti Computing</strong> (our partner) uses superconducting qubits; they also went public in 2022 and operate a 80-qubit system, aiming for modular scalable approaches. <strong>D-Wave Systems</strong> focuses on quantum annealing, offering 5000+ qubit annealers for optimization problems (though not universal gate quantum computers). <strong>PsiQuantum</strong> is a stealthier unicorn pursuing photonic qubits, aiming for a million-qubit fault-tolerant system via silicon photonics by late 2020s. These startups have raised substantial capital (IonQ ~$84M pre-IPO, Rigetti ~$200M, D-Wave &gt;$300M, PsiQuantum ~$665M) and are racing to build scalable quantum processors. <strong>Strengths:</strong> deep technical focus, often top-tier scientific founders, and first-mover advantage in their specific hardware modality. <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> high burn rates, narrow scope (hardware only), and dependence on solving extremely hard physics/engineering problems. <strong>QDaria’s differentiation:</strong> We are <em>hardware-agnostic</em> and <strong>capital efficient</strong>. Rather than build our own quantum chip from scratch, we partner with or rent existing hardware. For example, through Rigetti we plan to use the Novera QPU (84-qubit) in Norway, and through kit rentals we offer SpinQ’s room-temperature quantum devices. This means our capital requirements are lower, and we avoid betting on a single hardware approach. We also layer value through software and AI on top of any hardware. In essence, while IonQ/Rigetti focus on <em>making qubits</em>, QDaria focuses on <em>making qubits useful</em> via algorithms, integration, and user-friendly AI. This strategy also lets us <strong>pivot</strong>: if one quantum technology lags, we can switch to another available via cloud. Our risk is dependency on the hardware ecosystem’s progress – but given the billions pouring into hardware globally, we’re confident at least some platforms will advance sufficiently. When they do, we are ready to capitalize on them with our applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum Software &amp; Algorithm Startups (Quantinuum, Zapata, QC Ware, etc.)</strong> – A number of ventures focus on the software layer of quantum computing. <strong>Quantinuum</strong> (formed by the merger of Honeywell’s quantum division and Cambridge Quantum) is a leader in quantum software, with products in cryptography (e.g. Quantum Origin) and chemistry, and also provides hardware access via Honeywell’s trapped-ion systems. <strong>Zapata Computing</strong> offers a software platform (Orquestra) for quantum machine learning and optimization, targeting enterprise use cases. <strong>QC Ware</strong> provides quantum consulting and has developed algorithms especially for finance and chemistry, also offering a cloud platform (Forge). These companies often generate revenue through partnerships and pilot projects with large companies looking to explore quantum solutions. <strong>Strengths:</strong> strong algorithms expertise, hardware-agnostic integration, often partnerships with both hardware providers and enterprise clients. <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Many are service-oriented (consulting-heavy) and face long sales cycles; their solutions sometimes lack differentiation as others can replicate algorithms; they may not leverage AI heavily in their offerings. <strong>QDaria’s differentiation:</strong> We also develop quantum software and algorithms, but <em>QDaria’s agentic AI focus sets us apart</em>. We aren’t just delivering quantum algorithms; we are packaging them in intelligent, interactive AI agents (QDiana, QMikeAI) that make the technology accessible to end-users. This higher-level interface can provide a competitive moat – it’s one thing to have an algorithm library, it’s another to have a conversational AI that solves problems for you using those algorithms. Additionally, QDaria offers something these players do not: <strong>physical hardware access</strong>. Through our kit rental program, a client can actually <em>touch</em> and experiment on a real quantum device in-house, rather than only via cloud API. This tangible aspect, combined with our AI guidance, creates a user experience that is unique. Our vision of integrating quantum, AI, and even VR (for QDiana’s virtual labs) is more holistic than the relatively siloed approach of most quantum software startups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Academic and National Lab Efforts:</strong> There is significant “competition” (or rather, parallel effort) from academic consortia and government labs, especially in topological quantum computing (which is QDaria’s ultimate hardware pursuit). Notably, Microsoft has partnered with University of Copenhagen on anyon-based qubits (though results have been mixed), and EU’s Quantum Flagship funds many projects in superconducting and topological qubits. Additionally, companies like <strong>Nordic Quantum Computing Group</strong> in Finland or <strong>IQM</strong> (Europe) could be regional competitors, focusing on hardware. However, in Norway specifically, QDaria currently stands out as the first dedicated quantum computing startup. Our collaboration with Norwegian research institutions and international partners (Rigetti, Bluefors, etc.) is aimed at <strong>cementing local leadership</strong> before others emerge. We intend to maintain a strong R&amp;D collaboration network to stay at the forefront of scientific progress while executing commercially faster than academia typically can.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, QDaria faces competition from very powerful incumbents and well-funded startups, but <strong>our strategy occupies a unique niche</strong>. By combining:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Hardware access</strong> (through our in-house quantum kit rentals and Rigetti partnership),</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum software solutions</strong> (Zipminator, Qm9, etc.), and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agentic AI interfaces</strong> (QDiana, QMikeAI),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>we offer a <em>holistic value proposition</em> that others do not. This integrated approach – quantum hardware + software + AI + domain expertise – can make quantum technology more usable and impactful for end users, effectively creating a one-stop shop. Rather than competing head-on with any single category of player, we blend elements of all three (hardware, software, AI) in a novel way. We will need to stay laser-focused and excel in our niche, but if we do, QDaria can establish a defensible beachhead. Our advantages can be summarized as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>First-mover in Q+AI Fusion:</strong> Few companies globally are as explicitly focused on quantum+AI synergy as QDaria. We aim to develop proprietary techniques (and IP) in this fusion, creating high-performance AI that leverages quantum backends and quantum control enhanced by AI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware-Agnostic with Local Hardware Presence:</strong> We leverage the best available hardware (from partners) without heavy CAPEX, yet differentiate by actually <strong>hosting hardware locally</strong> (e.g., Novera QPU in Oslo) for demonstration and PR value. This gives us a platform to rally local talent and customers, while still being nimble in choice of technology.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interdisciplinary R&amp;D</strong>: QDaria’s team composition (quantum physicists, AI experts, biologists, etc.) and broad scope mean we can pursue cross-disciplinary innovations competitors might miss. For example, our work in quantum biology or AGI governance provides optionality to enter fields others aren’t touching, all under one roof.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User-Centric Design:</strong> Through QDiana’s educational platform, VR labs, and AI assistants, we prioritize <strong>user experience</strong> – making complex tech intuitive. This is in contrast to many deep-tech firms that expect clients to have in-house quantum expertise. Our approach can dramatically shorten the adoption curve for customers, effectively cultivating our own future market by educating and guiding users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to continue leveraging partnerships (with both larger companies and research orgs) to complement our strengths. For instance, rather than build a dilution refrigerator ourselves, we’ll buy from Bluefors; rather than maintain a cloud data center, we’ll use AWS; rather than hire 100 PhDs, we’ll co-publish with universities. This partnership model lets us punch above our weight and turn would-be competitors into collaborators. In summary, QDaria’s <strong>competitive moat</strong> will be our unique combination of quantum + AI capabilities and a focus on practical, user-friendly solutions – all executed with startup agility.</p>

<h2>Products and Services<a class="headerlink" href="#products-and-services" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>QDaria’s business model spans <strong>software, AI, and hardware access</strong>. Our strategy is to develop multiple, complementary products that address different facets of the quantum and AI revolution. Each major product is intended to become a standalone venture (subsidiary) under QDaria Holdings in the future. Here we present our seven core technologies (plus our hardware rental service), all of which are being built with an eye toward early commercialization:</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Experimental Kits Rental:</strong></p>
<p>We rent out small-scale <strong>quantum computing kits</strong> to researchers, educators, and enterprise R&amp;D teams – a unique offering designed to <strong>democratize access</strong> to quantum hardware. These “quantum kits” are essentially desktop quantum devices (such as SpinQ Technology’s portable quantum computers) that operate at room temperature and have 2-3 qubits. They can perform basic quantum algorithms and demonstrations. Purchasing such devices outright can cost tens of thousands of dollars (e.g. ~$9,000 for a 2-qubit model, up to $50,000+ for high-end 3-qubit systems). QDaria will maintain an inventory and offer them on a <strong>rental or subscription basis</strong>. For example, a university might rent a 2-qubit kit for a semester-long quantum computing course, or a biotech company might lease a 3-qubit unit for 6 months to test quantum chemistry algorithms in-house. This lowers the barrier to hands-on experimentation – clients get real quantum hardware on their premises <strong>without the overhead</strong> of buying and maintaining it. As part of the rental, we provide support services, setup assistance, and experiment guides (often via our QMikeAI assistant). This creates a revenue stream from rental fees and service contracts, and also serves as a pipeline for deeper customer engagement (clients who start with a kit can later upgrade to cloud quantum services or software solutions through us). We’ve established supplier relationships to procure these kits and launched a pilot program in late 2025 with a partner university. In addition, through our Rigetti partnership, we plan to host a <strong>dilution refrigerator with a superconducting processor</strong> (the Novera QPU) in Oslo – while not a rental item, it will be accessible for demos and specialized projects, further reinforcing our hardware access advantage. <em>Revenue model:</em> monthly rental fees, service/support fees, and potential sponsorships (e.g., a tech company sponsoring kits to be placed in underfunded schools, with QDaria as the facilitator). This service builds our brand as an educator and enabler in the quantum space.</p>
<p><strong>Zipminator (Quantum-Resistant Cybersecurity Platform):</strong></p>
<p>Zipminator is QDaria’s proprietary cybersecurity solution aimed at protecting data in the <strong>post-quantum</strong> era. Originally conceived by our CEO in an earlier role, the name comes from “zipping” (compressing or securing) information. <strong>Zipminator</strong> is being developed as a suite of quantum-resistant encryption and data compression tools. In its first iteration, it will integrate the latest <strong>NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards</strong> – such as CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium for encryption and digital signatures – to ensure that data encrypted today remains secure against future quantum attacks. It will also offer <strong>quantum-enhanced compression</strong>, leveraging quantum algorithms to achieve higher compression ratios than classical methods for certain data types. For example, using variational quantum algorithms, Zipminator could find more efficient encodings for genomic data or IoT sensor streams. The near-term goal (v1.0 by Q1 2025) is to release a software toolkit for enterprises and government agencies that provides drop-in replacements for classical encryption (so they can easily “quantum-proof” their data pipelines). In parallel, we are exploring a longer-term, high-risk component: using topological qubits to implement on-the-fly encryption that is theoretically unbreakable even by quantum computers (leveraging concepts of quantum chaos). <em>Market:</em> Governments, defense, banks, cloud providers – anyone with long-lived sensitive data that must remain secure for decades. <em>Revenue model:</em> Enterprise software licensing or SaaS. We might offer Zipminator as a cloud service (e.g., an API to securely store data with PQC and quantum compression) or as on-premise software for clients with high security needs. Eventually, Zipminator Inc. could spin off as a cybersecurity company targeting the intersection of AI and quantum security (e.g., protecting AI models and data from quantum-enabled breaches). We note that being early in PQC is important, as standards are being set now; QDaria has the opportunity to establish itself as a leader in quantum-safe data solutions with Zipminator.</p>
<p><strong>Qm9 (Quantum FinTech Platform):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Qm9</strong> is the codename for QDaria’s <strong>quantum finance platform</strong>, an integrated toolkit for high-speed trading, risk analysis, and financial optimization using quantum algorithms. The name evokes “quantum minus 9” (perhaps referencing $10^{-9}$, suggesting precision). Qm9 will combine advanced algorithms from quantum computing and AI to tackle problems like <strong>portfolio optimization, options pricing, fraud detection, and high-frequency trading strategies</strong>. For instance, quantum algorithms (QAOA or quantum annealing) can be used to solve portfolio optimization with many constraints faster or find arbitrage opportunities by solving large linear systems (for pricing) more efficiently. Qm9 will also process <strong>market data in real-time</strong> using classical AI (for pattern recognition) augmented by quantum subroutines for heavy lifting. We envision Qm9 as a <strong>Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS)</strong> platform focused on financial applications. It will be cloud-based, interfacing with both quantum hardware (superconducting qubits, ion traps, etc., whichever is optimal for a given algorithm) and classical HPC resources for hybrid solutions. A key feature will be an easy-to-use API and perhaps a visual interface where quantitative analysts can upload their problems (e.g., “optimize this portfolio of 1000 assets under these constraints”) and Qm9 determines whether to use classical solvers, quantum solvers, or a mix, returning the best result. By abstracting the complexity, we make quantum power accessible to fintech users who aren’t quantum experts. <em>Status:</em> We plan an initial release (v1.0) by mid-2025 focusing on one or two showcase applications – e.g., a quantum-enhanced <strong>Monte Carlo simulation</strong> engine for risk, or a quantum optimizer for asset allocation – demonstrating speedups vs classical methods. <em>Revenue:</em> Qm9 could start as a project-based consulting tool (we work with a hedge fund to apply it, and get paid for outcomes or licensing), then evolve into a subscription platform for financial institutions. By 2028, we anticipate Qm9 Inc. generating recurring SaaS revenue, and potentially partnering with stock exchanges or large banks to integrate quantum methods into their infrastructure. Notably, one component of Qm9’s strategy is our <strong>Q-Investment Hub</strong>: as mentioned in QDaria’s vision, we may allocate a portion of our own capital to algorithmic trading using Qm9, effectively dogfooding our tech and generating income (some of which would feed R&amp;D). This is a unique approach where QDaria could partially fund itself through quantum-powered trading gains, while also proving out Qm9’s capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>QDiana (AI-Education System &amp; “AGI Politician”):</strong></p>
<p><strong>QDiana</strong> is an ambitious project that started as two ideas: an AI-powered <strong>education platform</strong> and an <strong>AGI Politician</strong> for modeling governance. We have merged these concepts into a single AI system persona named QDiana, which is envisioned as the world’s most advanced <strong>polymath AI tutor and advisor</strong>. On the education front, QDiana will be an interactive platform for <strong>accelerated learning in STEM</strong>, especially quantum computing. It will feature a conversational AI tutor (capable of explaining complex concepts in simple terms, answering questions, and generating custom lesson plans), as well as immersive content like virtual labs for experimenting with quantum physics. For example, a student could ask QDiana to demonstrate the double-slit experiment, and QDiana would guide them through a VR simulation. This ties into our social mission of improving education and preparing the next generation of quantum scientists. On the governance front, the <strong>AGI Politician</strong> idea is to use QDiana’s AI engine to simulate and analyze public policies. It could take in data and objectives (e.g., “reduce traffic by 30% without hurting the economy”) and suggest policy measures, model their outcomes, and even generate legislation drafts. While a true “AI politician” is speculative, intermediate steps like AI-driven policy analytics have immediate demand in government and think tanks. By combining these domains, QDiana becomes a broadly knowledgeable AI that can teach, advise, and even make high-level decisions. Technically, QDiana builds on a large language model foundation (we customize open-source LLMs with knowledge in physics, math, economics, etc.) and integrates a reasoning engine connected to external tools like our quantum solvers. So QDiana could solve a physics homework problem by actually running a quantum simulation via Qm9 and explaining the result – something normal tutors can’t do. <em>Status:</em> We plan to <strong>roll out QDiana in stages</strong>. In Q3 2025 we aim to release an <strong>educational platform pilot</strong> for a select group of students/universities – featuring QDiana as a “Quantum Professor” in VR/AR modules and traditional web. Meanwhile, we are developing an <strong>AGI Politician whitepaper</strong> and simple prototypes to test AI-based policy evaluation (this emerged from internal projects in 2019–2021). <em>Revenue model:</em> In education, QDiana could be offered as a subscription for schools or individuals (like a supercharged Coursera/virtual tutor). As an enterprise/government advisor, it could be a consulting SaaS tool (e.g., city governments subscribe to use QDiana’s planning models). Eventually, QDiana Inc. can specialize either in EdTech or GovTech or both, and raise capital accordingly. This product underscores QDaria’s ethos of applying advanced tech to societal good – better education and informed policy. It also generates public visibility; an AI politician concept garners media interest, which indirectly benefits our brand.</p>
<p><strong>QMikeAI (Quantum HPC &amp; Engineering AI Assistant):</strong></p>
<p><strong>QMikeAI</strong> is an <strong>agentic AI system</strong> tailored for scientists, engineers, and developers working on computationally intensive problems (like fluid dynamics, weather modeling, materials science) where quantum computing might help. The name “Mike” comes from <strong>M</strong>ultipurpose <strong>I</strong>ntelligent <strong>K</strong>nowledge <strong>E</strong>ngine – and perhaps a nod to the common name “Mike” as an approachable assistant. QMikeAI has a more technical persona than QDiana. It’s essentially a <strong>“quantum lab assistant”</strong> AI that can help with tasks such as: setting up complex simulations, suggesting optimal quantum algorithms or classical code, auto-tuning hyperparameters for quantum experiments, debugging code, and orchestrating runs on various backends (CPU, GPU, QPU). For example, an aerospace engineer could ask QMikeAI, “Simulate airflow over this new wing design at Mach 0.8 and see if quantum can speed it up.” QMikeAI would translate this request into a computational problem, decide if a quantum solver (like a quantum fluid solver or optimizer) could accelerate part of it, run those parts on Qm9 (which may use our topological QPU for certain calculations), and compile the results, explaining any improvements. A specific use-case we are targeting is <strong>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)</strong>: we plan to integrate QMikeAI with a quantum-enhanced CFD solver by 2026. The idea is to use quantum computing to handle certain turbulence calculations at the smallest scales (Kolmogorov scales), which are incredibly compute-intensive classically, thus enabling more accurate weather and aerodynamics simulations. QMikeAI would manage this hybrid simulation. <em>Differentiator:</em> QMikeAI, being agentic, can operate with some autonomy. If given a high-level goal (“improve the fidelity of this simulation within 2 hours of compute time”), it can iterate through different approaches (adjusting mesh sizes, trying a quantum subroutine, etc.) on its own. This is cutting-edge AI behavior that goes beyond static software – it’s like having a super-smart research intern who never sleeps. <em>Status:</em> A basic QMikeAI (text-based assistant) is in development, using an LLM fine-tuned on scientific computing knowledge. By late 2026 we aim to have it integrated as an alpha feature in Qm9, helping our internal devs and a few beta users. <em>Revenue:</em> QMikeAI could be offered to enterprises as a SaaS “expert system” – for instance, an R&amp;D firm pays per-seat for QMikeAI access in their engineering team’s IDEs. Or it could be part of a cloud platform (e.g., an add-on in Qm9’s interface where you summon QMikeAI for help). It might also serve as a differentiator to attract users to our platform over others. Eventually, QMikeAI Inc. can commercialize a generalized version for all sorts of HPC tasks, essentially becoming an AI DevOps assistant for the quantum era. This product also aligns with our plan to open a <strong>Quantum HPC Center (Lillian)</strong> by 2026, where QMikeAI would be the “concierge AI” helping users utilize the HPC + quantum resources efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>QNilaya (Quantum Health-Tech Platform):</strong></p>
<p><strong>QNilaya</strong> (the name connotes “abode” or “nest” – envisioning a safe space for healing) is our platform for <strong>quantum-powered healthcare and biotech solutions</strong>. It leverages quantum algorithms to accelerate tasks in drug discovery, medical research, and personalized medicine. The core idea is to use quantum computing for simulating complex biological systems and molecules, which could dramatically shorten the R&amp;D time for new treatments. For example, <strong>quantum chemistry algorithms</strong> can simulate the binding of a drug to a protein with high accuracy, potentially identifying effective drug candidates faster than traditional wet-lab experiments. QNilaya will offer a suite of tools: quantum simulation modules for protein folding and molecular interactions, optimization engines for finding drug molecular structures with desired properties, and AI-driven analytics to interpret the simulation results. Additionally, QNilaya will explore <strong>quantum machine learning on biomedical data</strong> – e.g., using quantum kernels to detect patterns in genetic data that might indicate disease risk factors, which classical methods might miss. The platform is intended for pharmaceutical companies, biotech startups, and research hospitals. In deployment, a pharma researcher could use QNilaya’s interface to, say, input a target protein and get suggestions of molecular compounds (generated by an AI) that are then evaluated by quantum simulation for binding affinity, narrowing down candidates for lab testing. This tight coupling of AI generative models with quantum evaluators could <strong>revolutionize drug discovery</strong> by iterating through possibilities much faster. <em>Timeline:</em> We plan to unveil a prototype of QNilaya by August 2025, likely demonstrating a quantum simulation of a simple biochemical molecule and an AI suggesting modifications to improve efficacy (as a proof-of-concept workflow). We also are forming partnerships with academic medical centers in Norway to pilot quantum approaches on specific problems (e.g., improving MRI image analysis or genomics data processing). <em>Revenue:</em> In the short term, QNilaya could generate revenue via joint research agreements or pilot project fees (pharma pays us to run feasibility studies on using quantum for their pipeline). In the long run, QNilaya might spin off as a <strong>Quantum BioPharma</strong> company, raising funds from strategic investors in healthcare. It could monetize via software licensing to pharma (or cloud access), and even by IP – if QNilaya’s process helps invent a new drug, QDaria could negotiate royalties or co-patent the discovery. This area also aligns with public funding opportunities (grants, EU programs) which we will leverage to subsidize development, as it has clear societal benefit. QNilaya’s success would not just be financial; it would concretely demonstrate quantum computing’s value by saving lives through faster medical breakthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>TeHaA (Quantum-Native NLP AI):</strong></p>
<p><strong>TeHaA</strong> stands for “<strong>Tegmark-Hinton Artificial Awareness</strong>” (a playful tribute to Max Tegmark and Geoff Hinton) and is the codename for our <strong>quantum-enhanced natural language processing (NLP) platform</strong>. In simpler terms, TeHaA is a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4, but augmented by quantum computing techniques. The goal of TeHaA is to achieve deeper language understanding and more efficient training/inference by offloading some computations to quantum hardware or using quantum-inspired algorithms. For instance, certain sub-tasks in language modeling (like semantic similarity search, clustering of contexts, sampling from probabilistic distributions) could be sped up via quantum algorithms (e.g., Grover’s algorithm for faster search, or quantum Boltzmann machines for sampling). TeHaA will also experiment with <strong>quantum neural network architectures</strong> – basically neural nets where some layers are replaced with quantum circuits. This could increase the expressive power of the model without proportional increases in parameter count. We intend to implement TeHaA using a combination of classical high-performance computing (possibly in a language like Mojo optimized for AI) and calls to quantum routines on our Rigetti QPUs. An example use-case: imagine a chatbot that needs to consider an enormous number of possible responses – a quantum amplitude amplification approach might let it evaluate many possibilities in superposition and collapse to a highly relevant response, making it more context-aware and concise. <em>Timeline:</em> We expect to release <strong>TeHaA v1.0 by late 2025</strong>. This initial version will likely be a medium-sized LLM (perhaps 6-10 billion parameters) that demonstrates a particular capability boosted by quantum – for instance, it might handle multilingual translation with higher accuracy on some tough examples thanks to a quantum semantic analysis step. We’ll run TeHaA on the Novera QPU for live demos, making it one of the first showcases of a hybrid quantum-ML workload on real hardware. <em>Market &amp; Strategy:</em> The NLP market is huge (enterprises fine-tuning LLMs for their needs, etc.), but directly competing with OpenAI or Google is not realistic. Instead, TeHaA will serve as a <strong>technology demonstrator and niche product</strong>. It can be applied in specialized domains where we have an edge – perhaps highly technical documentation QA (where quantum logic helps maintain consistency of answers) or in generative design of quantum algorithms (TeHaA could converse about quantum programs more natively than classical AIs). We may also explore licensing TeHaA’s technology or partnering with an AI cloud provider to incorporate our quantum optimizations in their models. As the field of quantum machine learning matures, TeHaA could evolve into a broader toolkit (e.g., a library that any NLP model can use to call quantum subroutines). In terms of business, TeHaA Inc. might stay within QDaria’s fold as a supporting tech rather than a standalone IPO, unless it achieves a breakthrough that warrants spinning out an AI company. Nonetheless, the learnings from TeHaA (and potential patents on quantum NLP techniques) will bolster QDaria’s overall IP portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Damon (Quantum Robotics Platform):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Damon</strong> is QDaria’s initiative to bring quantum computing into the realm of robotics and automation. It is a platform for optimizing and controlling complex robotic systems using quantum algorithms. Modern robotics – whether it’s a factory full of robots that need to be coordinated, a swarm of drones routing deliveries, or an AI controlling a sophisticated manufacturing process – involves immense computational challenges. These include solving difficult optimization problems (e.g., path planning, task scheduling) and handling high-dimensional sensor data for real-time decision-making. Damon aims to leverage quantum computation to tackle certain hard parts of these problems faster or better than classical methods. For example, a quantum optimizer can potentially solve the scheduling of 100 robots in a warehouse more optimally, reducing downtime and collisions; a quantum ML model might better fuse data from a network of sensors to guide a robotic surgeon’s instrument with higher precision. The <strong>Damon platform</strong> will provide APIs for robotics engineers to offload tasks like these to quantum or hybrid quantum-classical solvers. An initial focus is on <strong>quantum control algorithms</strong>: using quantum optimal control theory (and quantum computers to solve the math) to design control pulses or motions that are highly optimal. This is somewhat meta, as quantum control is often about controlling quantum systems, but similar math can apply to controlling classical robotic arms. We’re also interested in the intersection of <strong>quantum sensors</strong> and robotics – e.g., using quantum devices (like ultra-precise quantum clocks or magnetometers) on robots for better navigation and then processing that data through quantum algorithms. <em>Status:</em> We intend to launch <strong>Damon v1.0 in early 2026</strong> as a proof-of-concept. A potential demonstration would be a small robot whose movement planning is computed via a quantum annealer solving a maze puzzle, highlighting faster solution finding. Another demo could be optimizing the gait of a multi-legged robot using a quantum optimization loop (finding the most energy-efficient walking pattern). <em>Market:</em> Sectors like advanced manufacturing, logistics, and defense could benefit – anywhere complex automation is present. We foresee early collaboration with an industry partner (for instance, a robotics company interested in quantum edge). <em>Revenue model:</em> Initially project-based (e.g., co-develop a solution for a factory, funded by that client). Eventually, if Damon’s techniques prove value (say we show 20% efficiency gain in a certain scheduling problem), it could be productized as software integrated into standard robotics control systems. Damon Inc. could emerge as a quantum industrial tech company, possibly partnering with big industrial automation firms (ABB, Siemens, etc.) for distribution. Importantly, Damon completes QDaria’s sector coverage: where QNilaya covers bio/health and Qm9 covers finance, Damon covers the physical industries (manufacturing, transport). It demonstrates that our quantum+AI expertise can be applied literally from the <strong>nano-scale (quantum effects) to the macro-scale (robotics)</strong>, which is compelling to investors looking at total addressable market.</p>
<p>Collectively, these products form a <strong>cohesive ecosystem</strong>. Qm9 provides the quantum computing backbone and cloud infrastructure; Zipminator ensures security of data and communications in that ecosystem; QDiana and QMikeAI serve as intelligent front-ends for different user groups (business leaders/learners and developers/researchers, respectively); QNilaya, TeHaA, and Damon are specialized application stacks in high-value domains (biotech, AI, robotics) demonstrating the breadth of quantum+AI impact; and our kit rentals tie it all together by fostering a user base and community engaged with quantum hardware hands-on. A client can enter our ecosystem at any level of sophistication – a student might start by using QDiana’s learning platform, a researcher might rent a kit or use QMikeAI to test an idea, an enterprise might directly deploy Zipminator or Qm9 for a business need – and there is a pathway for them to utilize more of our offerings over time as they grow in quantum capability. This creates <strong>multiple entry points and revenue streams</strong> for QDaria while all reinforcing each other under one vision.</p>
<p>Currently (as of early 2025), most of these offerings are in development or early testing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We have secured a few <strong>desktop quantum kits</strong> (SpinQ Gemini devices) and plan a pilot rental program with a university physics department in Q4 2025 to gather feedback on the rental model.</p></li>
<li><p>A prototype of <strong>Zipminator</strong> is being tested in simulation, focusing on verifying its compression efficacy and integrating PQC algorithms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>QDiana and QMikeAI</strong> exist as conceptual prototypes – built on fine-tuned GPT-style models with added knowledge in quantum physics and coding – and are undergoing internal trials. We’re aiming to integrate a limited QMikeAI assistant into the Qm9 interface by 2026 as an alpha.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Qm9 platform</strong> is under active development, prioritizing integration with existing quantum cloud APIs (IBM Q, AWS Braket) and our in-house kits, and building a user-friendly dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>QNilaya, TeHaA, and Damon</strong> are in the R&amp;D phase: we have small teams (or partners) exploring use-cases (e.g., running quantum chemistry on small molecules for QNilaya, or experimenting with a quantum routine in an open-source robotics simulator for Damon). We consider these projects on track for initial demos in late 2025 (Nilaya, TeHaA) and 2026 (Damon).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The development of each product will accelerate once our seed funding is in place, as we will hire specialized talent (quantum algorithm scientists, AI engineers, etc.) dedicated to each line. Importantly, each product line has the potential to become its <strong>own company</strong> as QDaria grows – which is a central pillar of our expansion strategy described next.</p>

<section id="strategic-roadmap-and-ipo-timeline">
<h2>Strategic Roadmap and IPO Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#strategic-roadmap-and-ipo-timeline" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>To achieve our ambitious vision, QDaria will follow a phased expansion roadmap from a single startup into a <strong>multi-subsidiary holding company (QDaria Holdings)</strong> by 2030. Each major product will eventually operate as an independent entity under the group, enabling focused growth and separate capital raises, while benefiting from shared technology and strategy. Below we outline our plan year-by-year, including key milestones and how we will align product spin-offs with funding events (IPOs):</p>

<h3><em>(Figure: Planned QDaria Holdings structure by 2027, with subsidiaries for Zipminator, Qm9, QDiana, QMikeAI, etc.)</em><a class="headerlink" href="#figure-planned-qdaria-holdings-structure-by-2027-with-subsidiaries-for-zipminator-qm9-qdiana-qmikeai-etc" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>2025 – Foundation and Seed Stage:</strong> QDaria is officially (re)founded in Q1 2025 by our core team of quantum PhDs, AI experts, and industry veterans. Our initial focus is on building prototypes for Qm9 (quantum finance platform) and the AI agents (QDiana, QMikeAI). We establish a partnership with <strong>Rigetti Computing</strong> to gain access to their superconducting QPUs, and with <strong>Bluefors</strong> for acquiring a state-of-the-art dilution refrigerator to set up Norway’s first quantum computing lab. We secure initial <strong>seed funding of $12M</strong> (this round) to finance 18–24 months of runway. By Q4 2025, we aim to launch the <strong>pilot quantum kit rental program</strong> (with 2-qubit and 3-qubit kits deployed to first customers) and release <strong>Zipminator v1.0</strong> for early adopters. Key milestones for 2025: a working demo of QDiana assisting a user in a quantum experiment, a basic Qm9 trade optimization showing better results than a classical baseline, and local publicity from installing the Rigetti QPU in Oslo (positioning us as the first quantum hardware operator in Norway). We will also pursue grants and partnerships (e.g., EU Horizon funding for QNilaya research, or a pilot with a Norwegian bank for Qm9) to supplement our seed funds.</p>
<p><strong>2026 – Product Development and Market Validation:</strong> This year is about <strong>building MVPs and securing product-market fit</strong> for our primary offerings. With feedback from 2025 pilots, we iterate on the kit rental model (possibly scaling it to more universities or corporate training programs) and improve Zipminator’s features. We anticipate raising a <strong>Series A round (~$8M)</strong> in mid-2026 to accelerate development (though if the $12M seed is sufficient, this could be more of a seed extension). These funds will hire additional quantum software engineers, AI scientists, and business development personnel. By late 2026, we target a <strong>beta release of Zipminator</strong> that enterprise clients can trial and integration of a <strong>QMikeAI alpha</strong> into Qm9 for select developers. We also aim to announce a few <strong>strategic partnerships</strong> – for example, with a financial institution for Qm9, or a tech education provider for QDiana’s content distribution. On the quantum hardware side, QDaria will collaborate with Rigetti/Bluefors on operating the Novera QPU, possibly showcasing some results at conferences (IQT, etc.) to boost credibility. A key technical milestone is to demonstrate <strong>quantum advantage in a narrow task</strong> (even if simulated): e.g., Zipminator compresses a dataset 5% more than the best classical method, or Qm9 finds an arbitrage in market data faster than classical code. This will validate our approach to investors and clients. Revenue in 2026 may still be modest (perhaps from kit rentals and a couple of consulting engagements), but the goal is to have <strong>referenceable pilot customers</strong> and strong use-case data. By end of 2026, QDaria’s organization will start maturing – we’ll likely assign general managers to each product line internally, setting the stage to formalize the holding structure next year.</p>
<p><strong>2027 – Scaling Up and Organizational Structuring:</strong> By 2027, we expect to have early revenues and a growing team. Assuming our progress, we will pursue a <strong>Series B round (~$20M)</strong> in 2027 to scale the business. This funding is earmarked for expanding our reach: hiring more developers and sales teams, significantly boosting R&amp;D on <strong>QDiana’s full capabilities</strong> (target: a production-ready version of the AI tutor by late 2027), and enhancing the Qm9 platform for reliability and more hardware integrations. Importantly, <strong>2027 is when we reorganize QDaria into a holding company structure</strong>. We will incorporate separate subsidiaries for the major products:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>*   *Zipminator, Inc.* – Quantum cybersecurity unit.
*   *Qm9, Inc.* – Quantum finance/cloud platform unit.
*   *QDiana, Inc.* – AI education/governance unit.
*   *QMikeAI, Inc.* – AI developer assistant unit.
*   (Potentially also *QDaria Hardware Services* for the kit rental and any hardware operations, or that could fold under Qm9 or remain a division of the parent.)

QDaria Holdings will own 100% of each initially, but each will have its own leadership and could eventually raise external funding individually. This restructuring allows clearer focus and accountability: each subsidiary can develop its go-to-market strategy, form industry-specific partnerships, and if needed, seek dedicated investors (for instance, a pharma VC might invest in QNilaya if we break that out separately down the line). By the end of 2027, we aim for each unit to have a working product and initial customer traction. For example, Zipminator could have paying pilot users in government, Qm9 might have a couple of hedge funds subscribing, QDiana could be used in a handful of schools, and QMikeAI integrated into a few research labs. Collectively, these should drive QDaria’s **annual revenue into the 7-figure range (~\$1M+ by 2027)**, demonstrating real commercial viability. Achieving this revenue milestone, while still relatively small, is critical for convincing the market that we’re not just a research project but a business. We’ll also continue showcasing thought leadership – publishing papers, speaking at events (our CEO and key scientists will likely be regulars at quantum/AI conferences, which we’ve already begun as noted with Davos and IQT events). By late 2027, we may explore minor spin-outs or acquisitions if opportunities arise (for instance, if an academic spinoff has great tech that fits QDiana, we could bring them in).
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>2028 – First IPO and Continued Growth:</strong> 2028 is the year we anticipate <strong>taking the first of our subsidiaries public</strong>, marking a major validation and liquidity event for investors. Based on our plan, <strong>Zipminator, Inc.</strong> is the leading IPO candidate, likely in the second half of 2028. Why Zipminator first? By 2028, quantum-safe encryption will be a hot topic as large quantum computers loom closer; Zipminator will have a clear business model (cybersecurity software) and potentially significant user adoption (could be generating meaningful revenue by then if major enterprises have adopted our PQC tools). An IPO of Zipminator would raise substantial capital dedicated to its growth (e.g., to expand into a full security suite, maybe including quantum random number generators, secure communication networks, etc.), and also provide a <strong>proof point</strong> for QDaria’s multi-venture strategy. We, QDaria Holdings, would retain a big equity stake in Zipminator post-IPO, so any increase in its stock value accrues back to us as well. The infusion of funds and credibility from this IPO will benefit the whole group – it demonstrates that one of our bets can stand on its own in public markets. In 2028, the other units continue to grow:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>*   *Qm9, Inc.* should be signing up more clients (possibly offering a robust cloud service and perhaps partnering with a cloud provider for reach).
*   *QDiana, Inc.* aims for a full **commercial launch in 2028**, potentially landing a contract with a large educational institution or government training program.
*   *QMikeAI, Inc.* will work on building a community of developers – perhaps by integrating with open-source projects or academic programs to get wide adoption.

We’ll also consider whether to formalize **QNilaya, TeHaA, Damon** into separate entities if they have progressed sufficiently. It might be around this time that we spin one or more of them as distinct subsidiaries or internal divisions of existing ones (e.g., QNilaya could be housed under Qm9 or standalone). Throughout 2028, we leverage the momentum from Zipminator’s success to attract more partnerships and maybe non-dilutive funding (grants, government contracts) for the other projects. By end of 2028, QDaria Holdings will have one public company (Zipminator) and several late-stage startups under its wing, which sets us up for multiple follow-on IPOs.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>2029 – Multiple IPOs and Expansion:</strong> By 2029, we anticipate the quantum industry is in a robust growth phase; many applications are yielding value, and QDaria’s businesses are hitting their stride. We plan for <strong>two more IPOs in 2029</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- **Qm9, Inc. IPO:** As a quantum cloud/platform play, Qm9 could by now have a strong recurring revenue stream from financial and possibly other sectors using its services. If the market sees it as the “AWS of Quantum” in some niche, an IPO in mid-2029 could fetch a high valuation and provide capital to scale infrastructure globally (including establishing data centers near key clients, building more integrations with hardware, etc.).
-   **QDiana, Inc. IPO:** By late 2029, QDiana might have proven its worth in the education technology market and possibly even in government consulting. If it’s showing strong user growth (e.g., millions of students using it worldwide via partnerships) or if the AI-politician angle has gained policy-maker interest, QDiana could go public to fuel further R&amp;D (toward true AGI capabilities perhaps) and expansion into new verticals (like corporate training, or international markets).

With these moves, by end of 2029 QDaria Holdings would oversee **three publicly traded subsidiaries**: Zipminator, Qm9, QDiana. Each will operate with greater independence (their own boards, etc.), but QDaria will maintain significant stakes (ensuring we participate in their upside and still guide overall vision). Financially, these IPOs could partially monetize our holdings (if we sell a small portion in the offerings), bringing capital into QDaria Holdings which can be used to support the remaining private initiatives. We will carefully time and size these offerings based on market conditions – the plan is flexible; if markets are down or a unit isn’t ready, we might delay an IPO to 2030. The guiding principle is to unlock value without rushing. Also in 2029, we expect **quantum hardware advancements** from our partners (Rigetti’s larger QPUs, maybe early topological qubit prototypes from our own lab) which we can showcase as part of our narrative of being a cutting-edge leader. We’ll continue seeking **partnerships and acquisitions** to bolster each unit. For example, by 2029 we might acquire a smaller AI startup to enhance QDiana’s tech, or a niche quantum algorithm company to add to Qm9. We’ll also expand geographically – we intend to establish a presence in key markets (US, EU beyond Norway, and Asia-Pacific) to support global clients, either via partnerships or small offices.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>2030 – Final Planned IPO and Holding Company Maturation:</strong> In 2030, we foresee the last of the initial four core subsidiaries, <strong>QMikeAI, Inc.</strong>, reaching a stage for an IPO. QMikeAI’s trajectory is tied to the growth of the quantum developer ecosystem. By 2030, if quantum computing has become common in tech (even if still limited), there will be thousands of quantum developers and researchers globally – a perfect user base for QMikeAI’s assistant. We expect by this time QMikeAI will have a sustainable revenue model (perhaps enterprise subscriptions from research labs, or licensing deals with software like Visual Studio, etc.), and an IPO would give it visibility and funds to integrate with every major development platform. Once QMikeAI is public, QDaria Holdings will have <strong>four public companies under its umbrella</strong>. At this stage, the role of QDaria Holdings transitions to that of a strategic orchestrator and incubator. We may consider even listing the holding company itself (maybe on Oslo’s exchange or NASDAQ) if beneficial – though since the pieces are already public, the holding could mainly serve as a vehicle for original investors to realize remaining value and for raising group-level capital for new initiatives.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In 2030 and beyond, with our main ventures launched, QDaria will focus on **advancing the topological quantum computer project (the original GrailQ vision)**. We expect by 2030 to have demonstrated a working small-scale topological qubit system (possibly done in partnership with a government lab). Achieving a milestone like a logical qubit with Fibonacci anyons would be a capstone that elevates QDaria’s profile from an applications company to also a deep-tech hardware innovator. Post-IPO of all units, we can consider forming new divisions or investing in external startups to keep pushing innovation (e.g., maybe in quantum communications or quantum sensing – areas we haven’t covered yet). Essentially, by 2030 QDaria Holdings becomes a **quantum technology conglomerate**: each subsidiary focusing on its industry (cybersecurity, fintech, AI, etc.), and the holding fostering synergies (like ensuring tech transfer between units, unified branding where helpful, and shared access to our quantum hardware resources).

<p>This roadmap, summarized visually below, is aggressive but achievable with disciplined execution and adaptation to real-world feedback:</p>

<section id="timeline-of-key-milestones-20252030">
<h3><strong>Timeline of Key Milestones (2025–2030):</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#timeline-of-key-milestones-20252030" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>2025:</strong> Seed funding $12M secured; QDaria establishes Oslo HQ and quantum lab (Rigetti QPU install); Pilot programs begin (kit rentals, Zipminator beta).
<strong>2026:</strong> Series A (~$8M); <strong>Zipminator v1.0</strong> launch (enterprise trials); QMikeAI integrated (alpha) into Qm9; first revenue from pilots.
<strong>2027:</strong> Series B (~$20M); QDaria reorganizes into QDaria Holdings with subsidiaries (Zipminator, Qm9, QDiana, QMikeAI formalized); collective revenue ~$1M+; QDiana pilot in real environment.
<strong>2028:</strong> <strong>Zipminator IPO</strong> (Q3 2028); QDiana commercial release; Qm9 growing userbase (QCaaS); QNilaya and TeHaA demonstrate quantum advantage in respective fields; overall group revenue accelerates.
<strong>2029:</strong> <strong>Qm9 IPO</strong> (mid 2029); <strong>QDiana IPO</strong> (late 2029); each business scaling globally (quantum services, AI adoption); possibly additional spin-offs (e.g., if QNilaya or Damon are mature, they could raise capital or join an existing subsidiary for expansion).
<strong>2030:</strong> <strong>QMikeAI IPO</strong>; QDaria Holdings now oversees four public companies. Work intensifies on the flagship topological quantum computer (with aim to demonstrate &gt;50 qubits topologically error-corrected). Early investors realize exits through IPOs, and QDaria moves into its next chapter as a multi-venture enterprise.</p>
<p>This phased approach is subject to adjustment based on market conditions. If the market is not receptive (e.g., an IPO window is closed due to a recession), we can delay and continue to fund privately a bit longer, or if one product underperforms we might consolidate it with another. We have built <strong>flexibility</strong> into the plan – for example, we could swap the order of IPOs (if QDiana’s metrics surpass Qm9, maybe it goes public first), or decide to keep a unit private longer if it needs more maturation. The key point is we have <strong>multiple shots at success</strong> (each subsidiary can succeed or fail somewhat independently), which de-risks the overall venture. By 2030, in the successful scenario, QDaria’s stakeholders will have seen value creation through several liquidity events, and the company will stand as a diversified powerhouse in the quantum/AI industry.</p>

<section id="financial-plan-and-projections">
<h2>Financial Plan and Projections<a class="headerlink" href="#financial-plan-and-projections" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our financial plan reflects this multi-faceted growth strategy. We forecast financials for QDaria Holdings on a consolidated basis through 2030, understanding that different lines of business scale at different paces. Early on, revenue will be modest as we prove technology and build products; by the late 2020s, we expect an inflection as products commercialize and subsidiaries IPO, improving both our top-line and bottom-line substantially.</p>
<section id="projected-revenue-gross-profit-and-net-income-for-qdaria-base-case-scenario-20252030-the-company-scales-revenue-from-0-in-2024-to-100m-by-2030-turning-profitable-around-2029">
<h3><em>Projected Revenue, Gross Profit, and Net Income for QDaria (base case scenario, 2025–2030). The company scales revenue from ~$0 in 2024 to ~$100M by 2030, turning profitable around 2029.</em><a class="headerlink" href="#projected-revenue-gross-profit-and-net-income-for-qdaria-base-case-scenario-20252030-the-company-scales-revenue-from-0-in-2024-to-100m-by-2030-turning-profitable-around-2029" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Key Financial Assumptions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Revenue Drivers:</strong> From 2025–2026, revenue is primarily from <strong>quantum kit rentals</strong> and <strong>consulting/pilot projects</strong> (e.g., a paid proof-of-concept for Qm9 at a hedge fund, or a custom AI solution using QDiana for a client). These are relatively low-volume, high-touch sales. Starting 2027, as products hit the market, <strong>software and platform sales</strong> ramp up. By 2028–2030, we assume our main revenue streams are SaaS subscriptions (for QDiana in enterprises or QMikeAI seats, etc.), usage fees (for Qm9 cloud platform), and software licensing (Zipminator corporate licenses, etc.). We project overall revenue growing from virtually nil in 2024 to ~$1M in 2027, ~$20M in 2028, ~$50M in 2029, reaching about $100M in 2030 in our base-case. This represents a ~110% CAGR from 2026 to 2030 – aggressive, but plausible given the high-growth markets and multiple product launches (for comparison, many successful SaaS companies have 50–100% annual growth in early years, and we have multiple engines of growth).</p>
<p><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> In early years, a large portion of spend is <strong>R&amp;D</strong> – roughly 55–60% of expenses through 2026. We invest heavily in developing the complex tech (quantum algorithms, AI models). As products launch, <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expenses ramp up from maybe 10% initially to ~25% by 2028 (we’ll need to educate the market and sell enterprise deals, which may involve a direct sales force especially for something like Qm9 or Zipminator). <strong>G&amp;A</strong> (general admin) might be ~15% of spend initially (we keep lean operations) trending down slightly as a percentage with scale. One big cost unique to us is <strong>quantum hardware and cloud costs</strong> – running computations on quantum cloud services or maintaining our own QPU. We account for operating the dilution refrigerator and related lab costs under R&amp;D or COGS. Fortunately, these costs, while significant per machine (maintenance, calibration, etc.), are not huge relative to software revenue – one fridge might cost a few hundred thousand per year to maintain, which by the time we have tens of millions in revenue is small.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> Our business mix includes high-margin software and lower-margin hardware services. Initially, with kit rentals dominant, gross margins are lower (~50% in mid-2020s) due to depreciation of kits, hardware support, etc. But as software becomes the majority, blended gross margin should rise to ~70% or more by 2030. Software subscriptions and licenses can have 80–90% margins, whereas kit rentals might be 40–50%. We assume by 2030, software comprises ~80% of revenue, hardware/services ~20%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Profitability Timeline:</strong> We do not expect to be net profitable until around <strong>2029</strong> in the base case. The rationale: we will continually reinvest in growth (especially expanding each venture pre-IPO). Operating losses will likely peak in 2026-2027 as we scale R&amp;D and staff up ahead of significant revenue. By 2028, one subsidiary (Zipminator) might already be profitable on its own, but consolidated QDaria will still be investing in others. After the 2028 IPO, Zipminator’s financials separate (but for modeling we still consolidate until we possibly partially divest). By 2029, the combined revenue from multiple products starts covering our consolidated costs, and we anticipate crossing into <strong>positive net income in 2029</strong>. By 2030, with substantial revenue and the benefit of scale, net margins could reach 20–25% (typical of a software-heavy group).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Funding Plan:</strong> We’ve mentioned fundraising at various stages: $12M seed (current), Series A ~$8M (2026), Series B ~$20M (2027). Post-2027, the IPOs serve as funding events for the subsidiaries, so we don’t model large private raises beyond B. If needed, we could do a Series C at holding level or late-stage in a subsidiary, but ideally the IPOs provide the growth capital. We also assume the ability to access some <strong>grant funding</strong> (especially for our research-heavy projects like topological qubits or quantum education) – say a few million spread over years, which we haven’t explicitly added but could extend runway or reduce need for external capital slightly.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>uses</em> of the initial seed and subsequent funding:</p>
<section id="planned-allocation-of-the-12m-seed-funding-approximate-a-large-portion-25-for-critical-equipment-and-the-rest-divided-among-talent-product-development-and-operations">
<h4><em>Planned allocation of the $12M seed funding (approximate): a large portion (25%) for critical equipment, and the rest divided among talent, product development, and operations.</em><a class="headerlink" href="#planned-allocation-of-the-12m-seed-funding-approximate-a-large-portion-25-for-critical-equipment-and-the-rest-divided-among-talent-product-development-and-operations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Hardware &amp; Lab Setup (~$3M, 25%)</strong> – This includes purchasing a dilution refrigerator (~$2.5M) and associated equipment (cryogenics, control electronics), plus a budget for initial quantum kits inventory. This capital expenditure is front-loaded (2025) to enable our hardware initiatives.
<strong>Team Salaries (~$4.2M, 35%)</strong> – Building a world-class team is vital. We plan to grow to about 10–15 full-time staff with this seed. Key hires include quantum algorithm scientists, AI/ML engineers, a cryogenic engineer for the lab, and a couple of software developers for platform/UI work. We’ll also have modest salaries for founders (we’ll mostly take equity, keeping burn low). This should cover roughly 18-24 months of payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Hardware Access &amp; Cloud (~$1.2M, 10%)</strong> – Aside from owning hardware, we will utilize cloud quantum services (pay-per-use on IBM/Rigetti for extra capacity) and classical cloud (AWS for our backend). We budget a portion of seed for these computing costs and any licensing fees needed for specialized software (like simulation tools or AI computing credits).</p>
<p><strong>Product Development &amp; Prototyping (~$1.8M, 15%)</strong> – This covers non-salary R&amp;D costs: e.g., paying for fabrication of any prototype hardware (if we, say, make a small chip for anyons experiment), data acquisition (like purchasing datasets for AI training or market data for Qm9 testing), and contracting specialized services (maybe UI/UX design, or short-term consultants for specific technical challenges). It also covers building initial versions of the platform (like the front-end for Qm9, or VR content for QDiana) through either in-house or outsourced efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Operational &amp; Marketing (~$1.8M, 15%)</strong> – Operational costs include office lease (our downtown Oslo HQ and lab space), legal &amp; accounting (setting up subsidiary structures, patent filings), and general admin. Marketing will be minimal initially but we allocate some budget for launching a website, attending key industry events, and producing promotional materials (demos videos, etc.) to begin building our brand and reaching early adopters.</p>
<p>This $12M is designed to get us through the critical “prove and launch” phase for at least 2–3 core products and set the stage for raising Series A (if needed) at a higher valuation once we have tangible results. Each subsequent funding round (A, B) will be tied to hitting milestones like product launches and user acquisition, and the use of those funds will increasingly tilt towards scaling (marketing, support, sales) versus pure R&amp;D.</p>

<p><em>(Note: These are illustrative base-case figures aligning with earlier discussion. 2025–2027 show losses as we invest; by 2028 we approach break-even; 2029–2030 become profitable. Optimistic scenarios (with faster quantum adoption or a hit product) could see higher revenues, while a conservative case might be ~50% of these revenues if adoption is slower. We manage expenditures accordingly to ensure sufficient runway under various scenarios.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Exit Strategy for Investors:</strong> The multi-IPO strategy provides a roadmap for liquidity events. Seed and early-round investors in QDaria Holdings can see returns as each subsidiary IPOs (for example, via share distributions or conversion into shares of the IPO entity, or simply through the holding’s value uplift). By 2030, our initial investors would have multiple opportunities to realize gains, and QDaria itself could evaluate an acquisition by a larger tech company or a merger if that maximizes shareholder value (though our preference is building the independent conglomerate). Given the broad scope of QDaria, there could also be partial exits – e.g., maybe a strategic investor buys one subsidiary (say a big cloud provider acquires Qm9 in 2030 for its quantum division). We remain open to the optimal path that balances our vision with investor returns.</p>

<section id="risk-factors-and-mitigation">
<h2>Risk Factors and Mitigation<a class="headerlink" href="#risk-factors-and-mitigation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Like any deep-tech venture, QDaria faces significant risks. We identify the major categories and our mitigation strategies:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Technology Development Risks:</strong> The pace of quantum computing progress could be slower than anticipated (or specific approaches might fail). For example, topological qubits might take longer to materialize, or the quantum advantage might be elusive for practical tasks. <em>Mitigation:</em> We adopt a <strong>hardware-agnostic</strong> stance – we don’t rely solely on topological qubits; we use what’s available (superconducting, trapped ions) and design our software to be flexible. If one tech fails, we pivot to another (our value is mostly in software/AI which can port to any backend). We also maintain strong ties with the research community to stay ahead of breakthroughs or pivot early if needed. Additionally, we incorporate classical fallback options: our products often have classical AI components that provide value even if quantum underperforms (so customers still get benefit, just maybe not as much as in the ideal quantum scenario).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Market Adoption Risks:</strong> Enterprises and institutions might be slow to adopt quantum solutions, either due to skepticism, lack of understanding, or integration challenges. Many potential clients might take a “wait and see” approach, which could slow our revenue growth. <em>Mitigation:</em> We address this by building products that are <strong>useful even today</strong> (before quantum is “necessary”). For instance, QDiana as an AI tutor is valuable even without quantum; Qm9 will integrate classical HPC so it can solve problems either way and deliver incremental benefit if quantum helps. Our phased approach (education first, then advanced solutions) is designed to <strong>create a pipeline of quantum-ready users</strong>. Also, our strategy of providing kit rentals and educational tools actually helps cultivate the market – the more people trained and comfortable with quantum via our platform, the more customers will exist for our advanced products later. Finally, we plan to provide strong customer support and consulting in early engagements to ensure successful adoption and ROI demonstrations, building trust in the tech gradually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competition and Talent Risks:</strong> We operate in domains where giants play (Google in AI, IBM in quantum, etc.). It’s possible a big company or well-funded startup could develop similar integrated solutions, or simply outspend us. Attracting and retaining top talent in quantum and AI is also a challenge, given competition from big tech and academia. <em>Mitigation:</em> We differentiate with our unique integrated vision, and we move <strong>faster and more flexibly</strong> as a startup. By the time a giant might consider doing exactly what we do, we aim to have already captured key customers or achieved tech milestones that give us a lead. For talent, we offer a compelling mission (few places offer the chance to work on <em>both</em> cutting-edge quantum and AI for societal good) and meaningful equity in multiple upside scenarios (the possibility of being part of several IPOs). We also have proximity advantages – being in Norway, we tap into a pool of talent that might be overlooked by Silicon Valley but is extremely strong (Nordic universities, etc.). We will establish collaborations and internship pipelines with universities to groom talent, and potentially set up an employee exchange or advisory roles with academic labs to keep talent engaged academically while working with us (common in deep tech startups).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funding and Dilution Risks:</strong> Building quantum tech is capital-intensive, and macro conditions can affect availability of capital. If the funding environment tightens (like higher interest rates making VC/IPO markets dry up), we might struggle to raise the planned rounds or have to do so at unfavorable terms, which could dilute early investors more than desired or force us to cut back plans. <em>Mitigation:</em> We pursue a <strong>lean approach</strong> where possible – leveraging partnerships as mentioned (so we don’t need to build everything in-house). We also are exploring <strong>revenue-generating schemes like the Qm9 investment hub</strong> which, while not traditional, could provide cash flow to support R&amp;D (i.e., we partly self-fund by practicing what we preach in quantum finance). In addition, our strategy to secure grants and government support (especially given Norway/EU interest in quantum tech) will provide non-dilutive funding to cover some R&amp;D costs. If the private market funding is insufficient, we can sustain longer on grants and minor revenues until conditions improve. The multi-spinout plan also means we can be flexible – e.g., if holding company funding is tight, maybe one subsidiary can raise money on its own from strategic investors to keep that part going (as was the case for some quantum startups taking corporate investments). Finally, by planning IPOs not too far out, we give early investors a clear line of sight to liquidity, which can make them more willing to provide bridge financing if needed in later stages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory and Ethical Risks:</strong> In the realms of AI and quantum, regulatory landscapes are evolving. AI, in particular, may face new regulations around transparency, bias, and data privacy (especially for an “AGI politician” concept!). Quantum encryption tech might get affected by government standards and export controls. <em>Mitigation:</em> We proactively engage with policymakers (our involvement in global forums like Davos indicates we want to be at the table in discussions). We design our AI with ethical guidelines (e.g., QDiana will have content moderation and bias checks built-in). For PQC, we stick to NIST standards to ensure compliance. On export controls: as a Norway-based company working with potentially sensitive tech, we will maintain proper licenses and possibly structure parts of the business in jurisdictions that allow smoother global operations (e.g., having a US subsidiary for any work with US gov). We also keep an open approach to security – working with agencies rather than in adversarial stance (i.e., if we develop super encryption, we ensure we are on the right side of law and work with governments for lawful use). By being aware and involved, we aim to navigate regulatory challenges without derailing our business.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, while the challenges are non-trivial, QDaria’s strategy is built to mitigate risk through diversification (multiple products/markets), adaptability (hardware-agnostic, incremental adoption path), and strategic foresight (partnering and structuring for resilience). Our leadership’s experience across academia, government, and industry gives us a well-rounded perspective to foresee pitfalls. We also prioritize <strong>transparency with investors</strong> – we will keep stakeholders informed and involved, so if course-correction is needed, we do it together. Managing these risks effectively will be key to QDaria’s ability to deliver the substantial rewards we aim for.</p>

<h3>Founders and Team<a class="headerlink" href="#founders-and-team" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Daniel “Mo” Houshmand (Co-founder &amp; CEO):</strong> An Iranian-Norwegian polymath, Mo brings a rare blend of artistic creativity and scientific rigor. He holds an <a class="reference external" href="http://M.Sc">M.Sc</a>. in Applied Mathematics, Mechanics &amp; Numerical Physics (University of Oslo), a <a class="reference external" href="http://B.Sc">B.Sc</a>. in Civil Engineering, and even a B.A. in Art and Design. This interdisciplinary background enables him to approach quantum computing not just as a science, but as an art – crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. Mo started his career as a data scientist in the public sector, where he developed a secure data-handling tool called “Zipminator” in 2017 (the genesis of QDaria’s cybersecurity product). He also co-founded a machine learning startup (iProud) as CTO, gaining early entrepreneurial experience bridging AI with real-world needs. In 2018, driven by a fascination with quantum mechanics and turbulence (inspired by research on cerebral blood flow during his Master’s), he convened a group of academics to explore building a topological quantum computer – this was the seed of QDaria. As CEO of QDaria, Mo has assembled a company culture that mirrors his own diversity of thought: QDaria’s divisions span quantum hardware, AI, biotech, and investment, reflecting his belief that innovation happens at the intersection of disciplines. He has been the visionary driving QDaria’s mission to make Norway a quantum technology leader. Mo is also the public face of the company, recently representing QDaria on the world stage at Davos and international quantum forums, where his articulate advocacy for “Quantum for Good” has earned QDaria global recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Astrid Sølberg (Co-founder &amp; Chief Science Officer):</strong> Astrid is a professor of Quantum Physics at NTNU (on sabbatical to help lead QDaria’s R&amp;D). A respected researcher in condensed matter and topological phases of matter, she studied under the legendary Jon Magne Leinaas (one of the pioneers of anyon theory that underpins topological qubits). Astrid brings deep expertise in the theoretical underpinnings of QDaria’s hardware ambitions. She heads QDaria’s <strong>Quantum Hardware Engineering Lab</strong>, working on material simulations to realize Fibonacci anyons and guiding the partnership with Rigetti on integrating our control software with their chips. In the 2018 precursor to QDaria, she led a team that published early designs of anyon-based qubit systems, laying groundwork for our current approach. She also mentors younger scientists in the team and liaises with academic collaborators (ensuring QDaria stays connected to cutting-edge research).</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Erik Johannessen (Co-founder &amp; CTO of Software):</strong> Erik holds a PhD in Computer Science (University of Oslo) and is an expert in distributed systems and cloud architecture. He previously worked at IBM’s Emerging Tech division. At QDaria, Erik architects the <strong>Qm9 platform and cloud infrastructure</strong> that ties our services together. He ensures our systems are secure, scalable, and performant. Erik was instrumental in setting up our hybrid quantum-classical workflow engine and integrating post-quantum cryptography into our stack from day one. As a native Norwegian and experienced engineer, he also handles a lot of the practical operations for our Oslo lab (from selecting the right cryogenics to setting up high-speed networks for our cloud connectivity).</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Nina Patel (Chief AI Scientist):</strong> Nina leads development of QDaria’s AI systems (QDiana, QMikeAI, TeHaA). She has a PhD in Machine Learning from Cambridge University and previously worked at DeepMind on reinforcement learning. Nina’s specialization is in multi-agent systems and explainable AI, which is perfect for creating our “AI agents” that can reason and interact with users. She joined QDaria in 2024 drawn by the challenge of combining AI with quantum computing. Under her guidance, QDaria is training custom language models infused with domain expertise (she initiated a project to ingest all major quantum computing textbooks and research papers into an AI knowledge base for QDiana). Nina also emphasizes AI ethics – ensuring QDiana as a tutor is unbiased and QMikeAI gives correct guidance – which aligns with our values.</p>
<p><strong>Other Key Team Members:</strong> We have ~10 additional team members and advisors as of 2025, including: a Quantum Algorithms Researcher focusing on quantum optimization problems (formerly a postdoc at ETH Zurich), a Senior DevOps Engineer managing our cloud and CI/CD pipelines (with background from a fintech startup), a Business Development Lead who was formerly at a tech transfer office (helping to forge industry pilot deals), and advisors like <strong>Prof. Leif Hansen</strong> (a prominent figure in Norway’s tech ecosystem, advising on strategy) and <strong>Dr. Maria Gomez</strong> (a pharma industry veteran advising QNilaya’s direction).</p>
<p>Our team’s composition – roughly half with PhD-level technical expertise and half with industry experience – gives us the capability to both invent novel technology and bring it to market effectively. We also emphasize a culture of continuous learning; many team members wear multiple hats (e.g., our quantum researcher also helps with training QMikeAI by encoding her problem-solving approach). This dynamic, cross-functional team is one of QDaria’s greatest assets in tackling such a multifaceted mission.</p>

<section id="product-development-timeline">
<h3>Product Development Timeline<a class="headerlink" href="#product-development-timeline" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Below is a summary timeline of expected <strong>product releases and technical milestones</strong> for QDaria’s seven core products (plus key infrastructure), as currently planned:</p>
<p><strong>Q1 2025 – Zipminator v1.0 Release:</strong> First version of our PQC-powered cybersecurity toolkit, including quantum-resistant encryption libraries (integrating CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium) and a beta data compression feature. Target users: select government &amp; enterprise pilots.
<strong>Q2 2025 – Qm9 Alpha (Quantum FinTech Toolkit):</strong> An early version of Qm9 deployed internally and to a friendly beta client (e.g., a Norwegian investment fund). Demonstrates basic quantum optimization on a financial portfolio and streaming data analysis.
<strong>Q3 2025 – QDiana Education Platform Launch:</strong> QDiana rolled out as an educational tool in partnership with a university. Features interactive quantum mechanics lessons, an AI tutor chat interface, and integration with our rental kits for lab exercises.
<strong>Q3 2025 – QNilaya Prototype Demo:</strong> Internal milestone where QNilaya successfully simulates, say, the interaction of a small drug molecule with a protein using a quantum algorithm, showcasing the viability of quantum in drug discovery.
<strong>Q4 2025 – TeHaA v1.0 (Quantum-Enhanced NLP Model):</strong> Launch of our first quantum-integrated language model, likely via a cloud API. It may be showcased analyzing some technical documents with improved context handling using quantum routines.</p>
<p><strong>Q4 2025 – Rigetti <strong>Novera QPU</strong> Live in Oslo:</strong> While not a “product” for sale, this is a key infrastructure milestone. The Rigetti 84-qubit system (Novera) is operational in our lab, enabling low-latency access for our development and regional users, making QDaria the first to run a quantum computer on Norwegian soil.
<strong>Q1 2026 – Damon v1.0 (Quantum Robotics Demo):</strong> We unveil Damon with a public demo, perhaps a path optimization challenge for a small mobile robot solved via a quantum annealer. This is likely at a tech event or press demo to show cross-domain capability.
<strong>Q2 2026 – QMikeAI Integrated Beta:</strong> QMikeAI is made available as a beta feature to a limited group (e.g., researchers in our collaborator network). It might be a plugin in a Jupyter Notebook environment that can be invoked for help on quantum coding tasks.
<strong>Q4 2026 – Zipminator v2.0 and Qm9 v1.0 Commercial:</strong> Enhanced Zipminator with full GUI and enterprise integration, and the first commercial release of Qm9 as a platform (with interfaces for algorithmic trading systems). By this time, we aim for paying customers or at least LOIs for both.
<strong>2027 –</strong> At this point, timeline becomes more dependent on results and market, but tentatively:</p>
<p><em>Mid 2027:</em> QDiana Professional launched (for corporate/government use, beyond education).
<em>Late 2027:</em> QMikeAI v1.0 standalone launch (possibly as a dev assistant plugin for VSCode or similar, with subscription licensing).
<strong>2028 –</strong></p>
<p><em>Early 2028:</em> Possibly <strong>QNilaya v1.0</strong> if development succeeds – a focused release tackling a specific use like quantum simulation for a particular drug target (could be in collaboration with a pharma partner).
<em>Late 2028:</em> <strong>Damon v2.0</strong> with integration into an actual factory pilot (stretch goal; dependent on finding the right partner and proving ROI).</p>
<p><strong>(Beyond 2028, the product timelines intertwine with scale-up events: e.g., by 2029 we anticipate second iterations of many products influenced by larger user feedback, but those specifics will be determined closer to time.)</strong></p>
<p>This development timeline will be regularly updated as we learn and as technology progresses. Not every milestone is guaranteed to hit exactly as planned (for instance, if a certain quantum algorithm doesn’t provide the expected benefit, a product launch might be delayed or pivoted). However, we include these timelines to show our current execution plan and how the various efforts sync with one another. The sequencing also highlights dependencies: for example, TeHaA leverages Novera QPU (available Q4 2025) to go live, QMikeAI relies on Qm9’s integration, etc., which we have accounted for in scheduling.</p>

<h3>Selective Technical Insights<a class="headerlink" href="#selective-technical-insights" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Topological Quantum Computing (Fibonacci Anyons):</strong> At the heart of QDaria’s long-term hardware vision is the use of <strong>non-Abelian anyons</strong>, specifically <em>Fibonacci anyons</em>, for quantum computation. In simple terms, anyons are exotic quasiparticles that can exist in two-dimensional systems, and Fibonacci anyons have the special property that when you “braid” them around each other, they can perform universal quantum logic operations. The promise is that information stored in the topological state of these anyons is inherently protected from local noise – meaning a quantum computer that uses them could be <strong>fault-tolerant by design</strong> (a qubit’s state is like a knot in the fabric of space that error noise cannot easily untie). QDaria’s research team, guided by Prof. Sølberg, is working on <strong>simulating and designing materials</strong> that could host Fibonacci anyons (such as certain fractional quantum Hall systems or new quantum hall heterostructures). We are leveraging tools like MatterGen (our custom material generator) and MatterSim (for physics simulations) to explore candidate systems. The eventual goal, dubbed “<strong>GrailQ</strong>,” is to build a qubit that is a pair of braided anyons, and to demonstrate basic gates by braiding operations (moving anyons around one another). While this is a longer-term, high-risk project, we’re tracking the progress of others (e.g., Microsoft’s approach with Majorana zero modes which share some conceptual overlap). We believe our <strong>hybrid approach</strong> – operating a near-term superconducting QPU (Rigetti) for immediate needs while quietly advancing topological research – gives us a competitive edge. If and when we achieve even a small-scale topological qubit (say 3-5 anyons braided), it would be a huge validation and could leapfrog us in the hardware race. We intend to publish intermediate results in academic journals (to build credibility and attract talent) while keeping any proprietary breakthroughs protected until patent filings (we have filed provisional patents on some simulation techniques and anyon-manipulation control methods already).</p>
<p><strong>Quantum + AI Synergy in Practice:</strong> A distinctive technical strategy of QDaria is embedding AI at multiple levels of our quantum technology stack. Concretely, we are developing an AI-driven <strong>automatic code generator</strong> for quantum algorithms: an AI model that can, given a high-level problem description, propose a quantum circuit or algorithm to solve it (essentially QMikeAI’s core brain). This involves training on a large corpus of known quantum algorithms and their natural language descriptions. We’ve found early on that GPT-4 style models can output basic quantum code (like Q# or Qiskit) from descriptions; we’re pushing that further by fine-tuning on specialized data and having the AI execute simulations of its own output to self-evaluate and refine (an approach similar to AlphaGo’s self-play, but for code). We pair this with a <strong>quantum heuristic optimizer</strong> – for example, using evolutionary algorithms (which themselves can be enhanced by quantum randomness) to optimize circuit parameters. On the AI side, for QDiana’s conversational ability, we’re incorporating a <strong>symbolic reasoning module</strong> that leverages quantum logic for inference. For instance, to solve a tricky logical puzzle a student asks, QDiana might internally set up the logical constraints as a satisfiability problem and use a quantum annealer to find a solution, then explain it. This cross-play between AI and quantum computation is cutting-edge and largely experimental, but our internal tests indicate it can improve accuracy on certain classes of problems.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Mojo and Advanced Languages:</strong> We are early**…Use of Mojo and Advanced Languages:** As an implementation detail, we are leveraging new programming languages like <strong>Mojo</strong> (a high-performance Python superset for AI/ML) to write performance-critical components of our hybrid algorithms. For instance, parts of TeHaA’s model and QMikeAI’s optimization routines are being developed in Mojo, which offers near <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C++</span></code></a> speed with Python-like syntax. This allows us to iterate quickly on quantum-classical code without sacrificing runtime performance, ensuring that when our AI orchestrates quantum tasks, the classical side is as optimized as possible. We believe this cutting-edge software engineering approach will give us an execution advantage and make our systems more efficient than those relying purely on legacy tools.</p>
