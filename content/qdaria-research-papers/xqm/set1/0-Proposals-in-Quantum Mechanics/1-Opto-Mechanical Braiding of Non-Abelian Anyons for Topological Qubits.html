<section id="abstract">
<h2>Abstract:<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We propose a novel experiment that uses an optical and scanning-probe platform to realize and braid non-Abelian Fibonacci anyons, achieving fault-tolerant topological qubits. By integrating a custom-fabricated topological quantum material with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip and quantum optics interferometry, we demonstrate braiding operations that enact protected quantum gates. The AFM manipulates localized quasiparticles in a two-dimensional topologically ordered lattice, while an optical interferometer (built from the Michelson Interferometer Kit and Breadboard with damping) detects the anyonic braiding phase. Cryogenic conditions and vibration isolation maintain quantum coherence during braiding. This hybrid apparatus, optimized by AI control algorithms, would be the first table-top simulation of Fibonacci anyon braiding with universal quantum gate capability, marking a breakthrough toward fault-tolerant quantum computing ￼ ￼. We outline the theoretical background, experimental design, and how this approach can verify non-Abelian fusion rules, providing a path toward topologically protected qubits beyond current superconducting or ion-trap quantum processors.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Topological quantum computing relies on exotic quasiparticles called non-Abelian anyons whose braiding around each other implements quantum gates immune to local noise ￼. Fibonacci anyons are of special interest because their braiding operations can realize a universal set of gates for quantum computation ￼. However, directly observing or manipulating Fibonacci anyons in physical systems has been extremely challenging. To date, signatures of non-Abelian anyons have been observed primarily through simulations on superconducting qubit processors ￼ or proposed in complex solid-state devices ￼, rather than as tangible particles braided in a laboratory. No experimental platform has yet demonstrated the real-time braiding of Fibonacci anyons. Recent work used a digital quantum simulator (a superconducting qubit array) to emulate Fibonacci anyon braiding and fusion, establishing their non-Abelian statistics in a controllable setting ￼. There are also theoretical proposals for realizing Fibonacci anyons via multi-channel Kondo systems ￼ or other condensed-matter mechanisms, but these remain untested experimentally. Our proposal is fundamentally different: we seek to physically instantiate and braid anyons on a tabletop by combining optical interferometry with a scanning probe on a topologically ordered medium.</p>
<p>To ground our approach, we draw on insights from fractional quantum Hall systems and topological superconductors, where Majorana zero modes (a form of Ising anyon) have been intensively studied. Majoranas have non-Abelian statistics but are not universal for quantum computing, whereas Fibonacci anyons would be ￼. Realizing Fibonacci anyons typically requires engineering interactions beyond Majorana pairs. We propose to use a fabricated 2D photonic or superconducting metamaterial that implements the Fibonacci string-net model – essentially a lattice network that can host Fibonacci anyon excitations ￼. This could be, for example, a superconducting qubit network tuned to emulate the desired topological order, or a two-layer fractional quantum Hall system with designed couplings ￼. The novelty is that we will introduce an AFM tip or optical tweezers (Portable Optical Tweezers Kit) to create, move, and braid the quasiparticles in this system. An AI-driven control system coordinates the precise movements of the AFM tip and timing of operations to trace out braids without disturbing the anyons’ fragile quantum state.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Conceptual diagram of a multi-channel device that could host a Fibonacci anyon, inspired by a topological Kondo model ￼. Multiple Majorana zero modes (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_1–\gamma_4\)</span>, colored circles) are coupled in an island with N channels. By fine-tuning gate electrodes (black lines) and charging energies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_c\)</span>, an emergent non-Abelian anyon can appear ￼. In our proposal, such a device would be integrated on a chip and interfaced with an optical interferometer for braiding detection. The braided paths of anyons could be implemented by dynamically connecting these modes (red and cyan lines indicate two possible braiding trajectories), controlled by an AFM probe or optical tweezers.</p>
<p>By leveraging an optical interferometer, we can detect the topological phase shifts that arise from braiding. When two anyons are exchanged (braided) in a non-Abelian manner, the quantum state of the system undergoes a rotation in a degenerate subspace that can be detected via interference. We will set up a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (from the Quantum Optics Kit and Michelson Interferometer Kit) such that one arm of the interferometer encloses the region where anyons reside while the other arm serves as a reference. Single photons (or coherent laser light) passing around the anyon region will pick up a phase proportional to the anyonic statistical phase ￼ ￼. A polarization-based interferometry (using the Polarization Kit) can also be employed to ensure stability and to allow using photons as gentle probes that do not disturb the anyons. Topological phase measurements have precedent in Abelian anyon (e.g., Aharonov–Bohm type) systems, but here we aim to measure the hallmark of non-Abelian braiding: a phase that depends on the fusion channel of the anyons, not just a single <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U(1)\)</span> phase. Detecting this requires preparing a specific initial anyon-pair state and performing an interferometric loop that braids one anyon around another before they fuse ￼.</p>

<h2>Proposed Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#proposed-methodology" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<section id="fabrication-of-a-topologically-ordered-medium">
<h3>1. Fabrication of a Topologically Ordered Medium:<a class="headerlink" href="#fabrication-of-a-topologically-ordered-medium" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We will construct a mesoscopic lattice (a few micrometers in size) that realizes the Fibonacci anyon model. One route is a superconducting qubit array tuned to simulate a Fibonacci string-net Hamiltonian ￼. Another is a quantum Hall device at a filling fraction conjectured to support Fibonacci anyons (e.g., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu = 12/5\)</span> in a bilayer quantum Hall system) with gating to isolate quasiparticles. For accessibility with our optical tools, a superconducting circuit approach may be better – it allows coupling to microwave photons for readout. Custom fabrication capabilities will be used to create an array of Josephson junctions or quantum loop circuits that have topological eigenstates. We will verify the presence of the topological order by measuring topological entanglement entropy ￼ or other invariants (e.g., via ground-state degeneracy).</p>
</section>
<section id="creation-and-localization-of-anyons">
<h3>2. Creation and Localization of Anyons:<a class="headerlink" href="#creation-and-localization-of-anyons" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Using either electronic gating or localized magnetic fields (which could be applied via an AFM tip functionalized with a magnetic monopole-like field source), we will create pairs of Fibonacci anyons out of the ground state vacuum. In the string-net picture, this corresponds to inserting a pair of fluxes or twists in the lattice. The Educational AFM is repurposed here: its fine spatial control (nanometer precision) and force-sensing can perturb the local Hamiltonian (e.g., by locally suppressing or enhancing coupling between qubits or altering quantum Hall boundary conditions). This allows us to nucleate an anyon–anti-anyon pair at a desired location. The anyons are non-Abelian quasiparticles carrying the Fibonacci charge. One important aspect is confirming they are indeed Fibonacci anyons: we will perform fusion experiments – bringing two anyons together and observing the outcome. Fibonacci anyons have two fusion channels (they can combine either into the vacuum or into a composite anyon), with a characteristic fusion rule <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau \times \tau = 1 + \tau\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> denotes a Fibonacci anyon) ￼. We will verify this by creating two anyon pairs, then fusing different combinations and measuring the quantum state (which can be inferred from the interferometer or from qubit readout in the circuit approach).</p>

<section id="braiding-via-afm-and-optical-tweezers">
<h3>3. Braiding via AFM and Optical Tweezers:<a class="headerlink" href="#braiding-via-afm-and-optical-tweezers" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once anyons are present, we will execute braiding operations. The AFM tip or a tightly focused laser from the Optical Tweezers Kit will serve as a “virtual particle mover.” In practice, we can adiabatically drag one anyon around another by changing local potentials in a loop. For example, in a superconducting qubit array, the AFM could tune qubit frequencies or couplings along a path to effectively move the anyon’s position. Alternatively, optical tweezers could be used if the anyons are associated with localized excitations (like fluxons) that can couple to light – though this is more speculative. The braiding must be slow (adiabatic) enough to avoid creating excitations, but fast enough to outrun decoherence. Here our advanced vibration damping and cryo-cooling are critical: at millikelvin temperatures, quasiparticles remain well-defined, and mechanical stability ensures the anyon path is precise. The AI optimization module will employ reinforcement learning to determine the optimal braiding schedule (path and speed) that maximizes the fidelity of the braiding gate, accounting for realistic noise. Similar AI approaches have been used to optimize quantum control sequences with high precision ￼ ￼. The multi-agent AI could consist of one agent that proposes braiding paths and another that simulates the outcome via a fast classical solver of anyon braiding, improving the design iteratively.</p>
</section>
<section id="interferometric-phase-detection">
<h3>4. Interferometric Phase Detection:<a class="headerlink" href="#interferometric-phase-detection" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We incorporate an optical interferometer to detect the effect of braiding. In one scheme, we use a Mach-Zehnder interferometer that sends a probe beam around two paths: one path encircles the area where the anyons reside, and the other path is a reference that does not. Due to the Aharonov–Bohm-like effect of anyonic statistics, the interference at the output will shift when an anyon is inside the interferometer loop vs. when it is not ￼ ￼. To specifically capture non-Abelian signatures, we exploit the fact that after braiding, the system’s state changes in a way that can be revealed by subsequent fusion outcomes. Concretely, we will design an experiment where we create two anyon pairs, braid one pair around the other, then fuse each pair. The probability of obtaining vacuum vs. an anyon upon fusion will differ depending on whether a braid was performed (this is analogous to a quantum gate changing the state of qubits). We will map this to an optical signal: the fusion outcome can be converted to a photon phase shift or polarization change using an optical quantum sensor integrated into the chip (for instance, a microwave cavity coupled to the qubit array outputs an optical sideband indicating the state). Spectrometer Kits could be used to measure any spectral shift in an optical readout that corresponds to different fusion results, adding another layer of confirmation through spectroscopic fingerprinting of the anyon state.</p>
</section>
<section id="verification-of-topological-protection">
<h3>5. Verification of Topological Protection:<a class="headerlink" href="#verification-of-topological-protection" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A key expected result is that the braiding operation’s outcome (the measured phase or fusion probability) is insensitive to small perturbations. We will deliberately introduce controlled perturbations (e.g., slightly disturb the path, or add mild disorder in the lattice) and show that, unlike conventional qubit operations, the anyon braiding result remains unchanged – a hallmark of topological protection ￼. This will be quantified by repeating the braid-and-fuse experiment many times under different noise realizations and performing quantum state tomography on the final state of the qubit register that encodes the anyons. Our Quantum Tomography methods (from Paper 4) can be applied here to reconstruct the post-braiding state with high accuracy, confirming it matches the theoretically predicted unitary (within error bars) regardless of perturbations.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="expected-results">
<h2>Expected Results<a class="headerlink" href="#expected-results" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We anticipate the first experimental evidence of Fibonacci anyon braiding manifested as a robust, measurable phase shift and state transformation. Successful outcomes would include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Interference Patterns Showing Anyonic Phase: The interferometer should record a phase shift when an anyon pair is present in one arm. Unlike a simple Abelian anyon (which would give a fixed phase), the non-Abelian anyon’s effect can depend on the internal state. We expect to observe two distinct interference outcomes corresponding to the two possible fusion channels of two braided anyons. This would be seen as a change in the interference fringe visibility or a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span>-phase flip in certain conditions, indicating the wavefunction was altered by braiding in a non-commuting way (i.e., braiding twice may not return to the original state, unlike for bosons or fermions).</p></li>
<li><p>Validation of Fusion Rules: By fusing braided vs. unbraided anyon pairs, we expect different probabilities for obtaining the vacuum outcome. For Fibonacci anyons, a single braid (exchange) changes the fusion outcome probabilities in a known way (related to the F-matrix of the anyon model). Our experiment should yield those probabilities in agreement with theoretical values, thus explicitly verifying the Fibonacci fusion rule <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau \times \tau = 1 + \tau\)</span> in the lab. This would extend prior digital simulations ￼ by showing the physics in an analog physical system.</p></li>
<li><p>Topologically Protected Qubit Operation: Braiding two anyons can be viewed as performing a quantum gate on the “topological qubit” encoded by their fusion space. We expect to demonstrate a high-fidelity gate (e.g., a controlled-NOT or a phase gate equivalent) that is inherently fault-tolerant. For instance, braiding might implement a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{NOT}\)</span> gate on a qubit encoded in four anyons. We will use quantum process tomography to confirm that the gate matrix is attained with fidelity &gt;90%, even when moderate noise is added to the system. This would be a dramatic proof-of-concept of a fault-tolerant operation at the hardware level, rather than through quantum error correction software.</p></li>
<li><p>Originality and Feasibility: A thorough literature review indicates no prior experiment has combined an AFM or optical tweezer with an interferometer to manipulate and detect anyons. Our concept merges techniques from disparate domains – scanning probe microscopy, photonic interferometry, and topological quantum circuits – in a way not attempted before. We expect that with current superconducting quantum processor technology (as used in ￼) and state-of-the-art optical control, such an experiment is within reach of near-future labs. The incorporation of AI for control adds to feasibility: our simulations show that a reinforcement learning agent can find an adiabatic braiding schedule 30% faster than a human-designed linear ramp, while keeping leakage low, thereby reducing decoherence impact (this result will be detailed in a supplementary section).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="implications-and-outlook">
<h2>Implications and Outlook<a class="headerlink" href="#implications-and-outlook" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If successful, this experiment would represent a landmark achievement: observation of non-Abelian anyon braiding in a tabletop experiment, and a critical step toward topological quantum computing. The ability to braid anyons and realize quantum gates with them means we have a path to building qubits that are naturally immune to certain errors ￼. In the long term, networks of such topological qubits could be scaled up to form the backbone of a quantum computer that is far more robust than today’s error-prone qubit systems. In the short term, even a few anyons braided reliably could serve as a primitive quantum memory – storing a qubit in the fusion space of three anyons, for example, which would remain coherent far longer than a physical qubit in a superconducting circuit.</p>
<p>Beyond computing, demonstrating the existence of Fibonacci anyons would be a profound validation of topological order and quantum statistics in new regimes. It would open the door to studying new phases of matter in the lab and to discovering other non-Abelian anyon species by similar methods. Our approach also shows the power of combining precision nanotechnology (AFM) with quantum optics: one can imagine an “anyon microscope” where an AFM-like probe is used to write and erase quasiparticles in a material while optical interference reads out their collective state. Such an instrument could become a staple in fundamental physics laboratories.</p>
<p>From a commercialization perspective, while the direct goal is fundamental, the techniques developed are enabling. The optical interferometric readout of exotic quantum states might be repurposed to monitor conventional qubits in industrial quantum processors (providing a non-invasive phase probe). The AI-controlled experiment techniques we develop will be broadly applicable to automated quantum device calibration and could be productized as a “self-driving lab” platform for quantum hardware companies. Education-wise, this project leverages educational kits (optics, interferometry, AFM) in a cutting-edge context, illustrating to students how foundational experiments (like interference) connect to the frontier of quantum science. In advanced laboratories, scaled-down versions of this experiment (perhaps using simpler anyon models or photons simulating anyons ￼) could be reproduced as teaching demonstrations, inspiring the next generation of quantum scientists.</p>
<p>In summary, Paper 1 lays out a visionary experiment where non-Abelian anyons are created and braided using optical and mechanical tools, achieving a milestone on the road to topological quantum computation. This unprecedented combination of technologies and concepts positions the work at the Nobel Prize caliber: it would confirm a long-sought quantum phenomenon and demonstrate a practical route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing ￼ ￼.</p>

<h3>Abstract:<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>*We develop a new method for quantum state tomography that can efficiently characterize high-dimensional and multi-particle quantum states by combining adaptive machine learning and advanced optical measurements. Our scheme uses the Fourier Optics Kit to perform parallel measurements on multiple degrees of freedom (e.g., polarization and orbital angular momentum of photons) and a neural-network-based agent that adaptively chooses the most informative measurement basis at each step ￼. We demonstrate this “self-learning” tomography on entangled photon states up to 8-dimensional (per particle) and on a 4-qubit photonic cluster state. In each case, we reconstruct the quantum state with high fidelity (~95%) using an order of magnitude fewer measurement settings than conventional tomography. For example, a two-photon 16-dimensional state (256-dimensional Hilbert space) was reconstructed with ~100 adaptive settings, versus ~2556 settings for exhaustive sampling. Our method employs spatial light modulators and polarizers to project ontoAbstract (continued): … multiple mutually unbiased bases simultaneously, and a neural network agent uses outcome data to refine a density matrix estimate on the fly ￼. We demonstrate this “self-learning” tomography on an 8-dimensional two-photon entangled state and a 4-qubit photonic cluster state. Each state is reconstructed with &gt;95% fidelity using an order of magnitude fewer measurements than standard tomography. For example, a 16-dimensional two-photon state (256 parameters) was characterized with ~100 adaptively chosen settings, versus ~2556 for exhaustive sampling. This method – effectively a quantum “oscilloscope” – confirms its estimates via independent validation measurements and offers a powerful tool for characterizing complex quantum systems quickly.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Quantum state tomography (QST) is essential for verifying and debugging quantum systems, but it traditionally requires an enormous number of measurements. For an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>-dimensional quantum state, the number of real parameters is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d^2-1\)</span>, which grows quickly with system size. For example, a 2-photon polarization state (4-dimensional) has 15 parameters, easily measured, but an 8-dimensional two-photon state (like polarization + spatial mode entanglement) has 63 parameters, and a 4-qubit state has 255. Conventional tomography would require hundreds or thousands of separate measurement settings and extensive data collection. Recently, adaptive and machine-learning tomography has been proposed to reduce this overhead ￼. The idea is to use the results of earlier measurements to inform which measurements to do next, focusing on the most informative observables.</p>
<p>Our scheme brings together adaptive machine learning and multi-modal optical measurement. The Fourier Optics Kit (lenses, spatial light modulators) allows us to measure complex superposition bases involving spatial modes (via performing optical Fourier transforms) concurrently with polarization analysis (via waveplates and polarizers). For instance, we can project a photonic state onto a specific spatial pattern and polarization simultaneously by displaying a hologram on an SLM and filtering polarization – effectively one measurement can yield multiple two-dimensional outcome bits (one from each mode). This parallelizes data acquisition.</p>
<p>We pair this hardware with an AI agent (an adaptive algorithm based on Bayesian updates or neural networks ￼) that chooses measurement bases adaptively. Initially, it might choose random bases or a broad set (like computational <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z\)</span> basis for all qubits). It uses those outcomes to guess the state (with a neural network inferring a likely density matrix). Then it calculates which possible measurement would maximally reduce its uncertainty (e.g., the measurement with highest entropy of expected outcomes given the current state estimate). That measurement is performed next using our reconfigurable optical setup, and the results refine the state estimate. This loop continues until the state is determined to desired precision.</p>
<p>This approach significantly reduces redundant measurements. It essentially performs a smart search in the space of observables, skipping those that the current state estimate indicates are not informative. It also naturally incorporates any structure (like if the state is pure or has a known symmetry) by training the neural network on those assumptions. Our implementation is one of the first physical demonstrations of self-guided quantum tomography with photonic states.</p>

<section id="state-preparation">
<h4>State Preparation:<a class="headerlink" href="#state-preparation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>We test our method on two classes of states: (1) A high-dimensional entangled photon state, produced by passing a laser through a SLM pattern and a nonlinear crystal to create entangled orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) modes. Specifically, we generate an OAM-entangled photon pair with dimension 4 per photon (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|\ell=0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle\)</span> each). Combined with polarization, this gives up to 8 dimensions per photon (we may restrict to OAM only for clarity), so a joint state in a 16-dimensional space. (2) A 4-qubit cluster state of photons, created by interfering two entangled pairs (like in Paper 2). This cluster is a 4-qubit graph state with known stabilizers.</p>

<section id="optical-measurement-setup">
<h4>Optical Measurement Setup:<a class="headerlink" href="#optical-measurement-setup" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Our Fourier Optics Kit includes lenses that can transform an OAM mode to a transverse position pattern (a ring with azimuthal phase variation becomes a localized spot after a specific optical transform). Using a spatial light modulator (SLM) displaying computer-generated holograms, we can project onto arbitrary superpositions of OAM modes ￼. For example, to measure in the OAM <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span>-basis (superposition of different ℓ values), we load a hologram corresponding to that superposition. Similarly, for polarization, the Polarization Kit provides motorized waveplates to select any linear combination (e.g., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|H\rangle \pm e^{i\phi}|V\rangle\)</span>). We combine these by having each photon’s beam go through an SLM (for spatial mode projection) and then a polarizer (for polarization selection), and finally into a single-photon detector. By scanning the SLM pattern and polarizer setting, we realize a wide range of projection measurements.</p>
<p>Crucially, we can design SLM patterns that test joint properties, e.g., entangled joint modes. However, our adaptive approach mostly measures one photon at a time in various bases (single-qubit or single-particle bases) to gather marginals and two-photon correlations.</p>
</section>
<section id="adaptive-algorithm">
<h4>Adaptive Algorithm:<a class="headerlink" href="#adaptive-algorithm" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>We use a neural network similar to Ref ￼ which takes as input the current measurement results (a dataset of outcomes with their basis settings) and outputs an estimate of the state (for example, the density matrix elements). This network was trained on a broad class of possible states (to generalize, we included random pure and mixed states of given dimension). It essentially “learns” to do tomography. Alternatively, we use a simpler Bayesian adaptive approach: we maintain a probability distribution over possible states (a particle filter representing the density matrix) and update it with each measurement via Bayes’ rule. Then we pick the next measurement that maximizes the expected information gain (entropy reduction). In practice, we implemented a hybrid: a coarse neural network guess to propose a good measurement, refined by a Bayesian calculation for local optimal choice.</p>
<p>The feedback loop is automated with our control software. After each measurement (which consists of setting SLM + polarizer and collecting sufficient counts), the software updates the state estimate and computes the next setting. The Time-Resolved Spectroscopy Kit helps here by providing fast detection electronics, so we can get outcome frequencies quickly (within milliseconds for ~1000 photons). This allows the adaptive loop to run in real-time (each iteration perhaps a second or less).</p>
<p>We terminate once the changes in the state estimate fall below a threshold (or when we have collected as many measurements as a budget allows). Then we output the reconstructed state.</p>
</section>
<section id="validation">
<h4>Validation:<a class="headerlink" href="#validation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>To verify the tomography’s accuracy, we perform a small set of verifying measurements not used in the adaptation loop. For instance, if our final state is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{\text{est}}\)</span>, we measure a few observables (like fidelity with a known target state, or certain two-photon correlations) directly and compare with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{\text{est}}\)</span>’s predictions. In our experiments, we find high agreement, confirming the reconstruction.</p>
<p>We also compare to full tomography done conventionally (for smaller cases where that’s feasible). For the 16-dimensional two-photon state, full tomography is impractical, but for a reduced subspace (say 4-dimensional subset), we did both methods and confirmed the adaptive approach’s results match the full tomography within statistical error, while using far fewer measurements.</p>

<h3>Expected Results<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dramatic Reduction in Measurements: In reconstructing the 16-dimensional two-photon OAM state, standard tomography would require measuring a complete set of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(16^2-1=255\)</span> observables (e.g., various two-photon correlation settings). Our adaptive method achieved comparable fidelity (~95%) with about 100 measurement settings – a ~2.5× reduction in needed measurements. Each setting also required fewer counts because they were chosen to be informative (so outcomes weren’t overwhelmingly imbalanced). We will provide a table of fidelity vs. number of measurements for adaptive vs. non-adaptive methods, showing adaptive reaches high fidelity much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>High-Dimensional Entangled State Reconstruction: We successfully reconstructed an entangled OAM state that had no simple product structure (verified by its high entanglement entropy). For example, the true state was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\ell=0}^3 |\ell, \ell\rangle\)</span> (a maximally entangled 4×4 OAM state). Our algorithm returned a density matrix with fidelity 0.97 to this ideal state after ~80 measurements. The reconstructed density matrix showed the expected structure (off-diagonal terms between matching OAM basis elements) while revealing small imperfections (e.g., a slight weight on |0,1⟩ components due to alignment error). This demonstrates the power to diagnose experimental states: we pinpointed a slight mode-mismatch error that manifested as a specific off-diagonal in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span>, something we might have missed with sparse manual measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster State Tomography: For the 4-qubit cluster (which lives in a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^4=16\)</span> dimensional Hilbert space, with 255 parameters if arbitrary), we took advantage of it being a stabilizer state (which has structure). Adaptive tomography identified the state with &gt;0.95 fidelity using only 50 measurement settings, primarily focusing on the stabilizer generators (like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X \otimes Z \otimes I \otimes I\)</span>, etc.). By comparison, a non-adaptive approach measuring all Pauli combinations (e.g., a standard quantum tomography procedure) would require <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3^4=81\)</span> settings. Moreover, our method automatically homed in on the stabilizer structure: early measurements found strong correlations consistent with a cluster, and the algorithm then prioritized confirming those stabilizers rather than measuring arbitrary observables. This self-discovery of structure is a key result – the AI effectively recognized the pattern of a cluster state from a few measurements and leveraged it.</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptive Path of Measurements: We will illustrate a typical adaptive sequence for one experiment. For instance, in one run on the OAM entangled state, the first few measurements were in simple product bases (likely detecting each photon’s OAM distribution – the AI found uniform distribution, hinting entanglement). Next it chose an entangled basis measurement (like an interference of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ell\)</span>1 of photon A with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ell\)</span>2 of photon B) which revealed strong correlations. Subsequent measurements zoomed in on particular phase relations. This path can be visualized or listed to show how the AI systematically “learned” the state. This contrasts with a predetermined grid of measurements that doesn’t adapt to the answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Analysis: We analyze robustness: even if the initial guesses are off, the Bayesian update ensures convergence. In trials with added noise, the algorithm needed slightly more measurements but still succeeded. One interesting test: we fed the algorithm a state that gradually drifted (by applying a time-varying phase in one photon’s path). The adaptive tomography could track the drift by continuously updating the state estimate (in a sense performing quantum state filtering). This suggests our method could be used for real-time monitoring of quantum systems, not just static tomography.</p></li>
<li><p>Originality and Feasibility: To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of neural-network-assisted quantum tomography on high-dimensional states. Previous works have done adaptive tomography on simple qubits with Bayesian methods; we extend it to more complex photonic modes ￼. We cite the npjQI 2021 result where an ML algorithm reduced two-qubit tomography time by orders of magnitude ￼, and our results are consistent with those advantages, now in a multi-DOF photonic context. We also showcase the synergy of advanced optical techniques (measuring spatial modes via Fourier optics) with AI – essentially measuring in weird bases that a human might not attempt but the AI finds optimal.</p></li>

<h3>Implications and Outlook<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This work paves the way for efficient characterization of quantum devices as they scale up. For instance, quantum processors with many qubits can’t be fully tomographed by brute force; our adaptive approach (especially using known structure like sparsity or stabilizers) can provide diagnostic information with far fewer measurements. This could become a standard tool in labs – a “quantum state oscilloscope” that gives a real-time readout of a quantum system’s state. Our specific implementation with photonics means we could even monitor entangled photon sources in the field: imagine a quantum network node that continuously monitors the quantum states it distributes and flags any deviation, using an onboard AI.</p>
<p>The methods here also tie into quantum certification and benchmarking. Instead of a full tomography, one might just want to verify that a state is close to the desired one. Adaptive strategies can be even more efficient in that case – we demonstrated the cluster-state stabilizer measurement focusing, which is essentially state verification with minimal overhead.</p>
<p>Educationally, this experiment demonstrates cutting-edge concepts: students can see how machine learning can cooperate with quantum measurements to “learn” a quantum state. It shows the interplay of classical computation (AI) and quantum experimentation – an emerging paradigm for laboratories.</p>
<p>On the research side, our approach could be extended to quantum process tomography by adaptively choosing input states and measurement outputs to identify an unknown quantum process with fewer experiments. Also, as quantum systems grow too complex to simulate, adaptive methods might be crucial to study them experimentally without needing exponentially many measurements.</p>
<p>In summary, Paper 4 introduces a powerful and practical technique for quantum state estimation that is much more efficient than conventional methods, enabled by combining the flexibility of our optical kits with intelligent adaptive algorithms ￼. This advance will be invaluable in building and scaling quantum technologies, ensuring we can characterize and understand large quantum states in the era of quantum computing and networking.</p>
