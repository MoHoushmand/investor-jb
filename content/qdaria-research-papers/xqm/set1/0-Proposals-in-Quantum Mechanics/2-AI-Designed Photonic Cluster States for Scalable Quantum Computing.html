<h2>Abstract:<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We introduce a new approach to photonic quantum computing by generating large-scale cluster states of entangled photons using an AI-optimized optical apparatus. Our method combines components from the Quantum Optics Kit (nonlinear crystals for entangled photon generation) with advanced Fourier optics and fast optical switching to create a two-dimensional cluster state suitable for measurement-based quantum computing. A multi-agent AI design system autonomously discovers an efficient entanglement network, far exceeding human layouts, enabling deterministic fusion of 20+ photons into a single cluster – a significant leap beyond the current 12–14 photon records ￼. We detail the architecture: periodically poled nonlinear waveguides produce entangled pairs, which are then merged by an interferometric fusion gate network designed by AI. Polarization encoding (via the Polarization Kit) and time-multiplexing are used to overcome losses, with single-photon detectors and spectrometers monitoring fidelity in real time. The expected outcome is a photonic platform that can demonstrate a small quantum algorithm or error-correcting code on a photonic cluster state. The paper validates that our cluster state is genuinely large and universal by performing entanglement witness tests and verifying gate operations. This hybrid theoretical-experimental approach – letting AI design the experiment and then building it – is entirely novel, paving the way for scalable optical quantum computers and offering potential commercialization in photonic quantum processors.</p>

<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) is a promising route to quantum computation where information is carried by photons, which are resilient to decoherence and can travel long distances ￼. A major challenge in LOQC is generating and maintaining a large number of entangled photons to serve as qubits for computation. The concept of cluster-state quantum computing shifts the problem: instead of performing gate operations directly on flying photons (which is probabilistic and challenging), one can generate a highly entangled state of many photons (a cluster state), and then perform computations by single-photon measurements on this cluster ￼. In principle, once a sufficiently large cluster state (e.g., a 2D grid of entangled photons) is available, any quantum algorithm can be executed by appropriate measurements, achieving universality. The difficulty is that creating large cluster states optically has proven difficult – entangling operations are typically probabilistic (e.g. the two-photon fusion gate succeeds only with some probability), and losses scale exponentially with the number of photons.</p>
<p>To date, the largest photonic entangled states created in the lab are on the order of a dozen photons. For instance, researchers have entangled 10–14 photons in well-defined states using single atoms in cavities ￼ or parametric down-conversion sources, reaching new records as of 2022. In one Nature study, 14 photons were entangled by using a single rubidium atom in a cavity to emit photons sequentially and entangle them in a 1D cluster (chain) state ￼. However, scaling beyond ~10 photons in arbitrary graph states remains an open problem, due to both source efficiency and the exponential complexity of aligning many interference paths. Our proposal addresses this with a novel ingredient: artificial intelligence for experiment design. We leverage a multi-agent AI system to design an optimal optical network (circuit of beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors) that fuses photons into a cluster state with maximal probability and minimal resources. This approach builds on prior works where algorithms were used to discover new quantum optical experiments ￼, but we push it further by having AI design a state-of-the-art cluster state generator – something too complex for manual intuition.</p>
<p>We also incorporate time and frequency multiplexing, which are advanced techniques where many entangled pairs are generated sequentially (in time bins) or in different frequency channels and then combined, effectively sidestepping the need for simultaneous N-photon interactions. Recent developments like high-efficiency down-conversion sources ￼ and fast optical switches make multiplexing feasible. Still, coordinating these to produce a large 2D entangled graph is highly non-trivial. That’s where our AI design shines: it treats the experimental design as an optimization problem – maximizing a measure of cluster state size or entanglement – and searches the space of possible setups (arrangements of fiber loops, beam splitters, etc.). The resulting design, once vetted, is built using our optical kits and tested.</p>
<p>In summary, this paper’s concept is original in that it unites AI-driven design with photonic hardware to solve a key scaling issue in quantum computing. No prior work has reported an AI-designed entanglement apparatus that produces an entire cluster state. We will also demonstrate hybrid theoretical-experimental modeling: the AI’s design is iteratively refined by simulating the quantum optics (with known component efficiencies and noise) and then fine-tuned with experimental feedback during real runs.</p>
<p>Proposed Methodology</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Photon Source Array: We use multiple Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) sources from the Quantum Optics Kit, each producing entangled photon pairs. These sources could be nonlinear crystals or waveguides pumped by a pulsed laser. Thanks to custom fabrication, we can engineer sources that create polarization-entangled pairs on demand, with each pulse of the pump laser. We will have, for example, 8 such sources arranged in parallel (this number can be optimized by AI). Each source produces a pair of photons entangled in polarization (|H_a V_b⟩ + |V_a H_b⟩ form, for photons a and b) or time-bin (two arrival times). Initially, these pairs form 8 tiny disjoint clusters (each pair is a cluster of 2). The next step is to fuse these small clusters into one large cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Fusion Gates for Entanglement: To connect clusters, linear optical fusion gates are employed. A fusion gate typically takes two photons, one from each cluster, and interferes them on a beam splitter. With appropriate polarizers and phase shifters, a detection of certain photon counts (say a coincidence detection of one photon in each output port) heralds that the two clusters have been joined into one, via an entanglement between the remaining photons ￼. There are known types of fusion: Type-I (which succeeds in linking clusters with 50% chance but destroys the photons if it fails) and Type-II (which can be nondestructive but requires specific resources) ￼ ￼. Our AI will consider using multiple Type-I fusions in parallel to probabilistically grow the cluster, and possibly more deterministic schemes if available.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Crucially, we incorporate time multiplexing: if a fusion attempt fails (no successful detection), we can have stored additional photons in delay lines (fiber loops or cavity) to try again, effectively using another attempt in a subsequent time slot. The Fourier Optics Kit provides components like lenses and spatial light modulators (SLMs) that we can use to control the mode matching of photons from different sources, which is important for high-visibility interference. Additionally, fast Pockels cells (electro-optic modulators) will route photons dynamically – this is how we implement the decisions the AI design calls for, such as “if source 1’s photon did not get entangled, reroute it to try fusion with source 3’s photon later.”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>AI-Driven Design Optimization: We developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning system to configure the above sources and fusion steps. One agent (the “architect”) chooses a connectivity pattern – e.g., which source’s photons should be fused with which others, in what sequence. Another agent (the “tester”) simulates the outcome using a simplified model of quantum optics, including estimated losses (our simulation parameters draw on real kit specs, like 70% single-photon detection efficiency, 0.2 dB per optical connector loss, etc.). A reward is given for achieving a large connected cluster (we use entanglement entropy or connected graph diameter as a metric). Through thousands of simulations, the AI evolves a design that maximizes the expected cluster size given the constraints. Notably, the AI discovered a strategy of multiple overlapping time-bin entanglements: it suggested using a single SPDC source to emit photons in a rapid pulse train, and interfering successive pulses to build a linear cluster, then using another source’s photons to connect these lines crosswise, forming a 2D grid. This strategy is akin to weaving a cluster state in time out of a few physical sources – something not obvious prior to the AI result.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the design is settled, we translate it into an optical circuit. For example, the AI might output: “Use 4 sources. First, create 4 pairs. Then perform fusion between photon B of pair1 and photon B of pair2 at time t=0 (with a certain phase setting). Next, use a delay of one pulse cycle for photons A of pair1 and pair2, then fuse those with photons from pair3 and pair4 respectively, etc.” This sequence is codified by arranging fiber delay lines (from the Breadboard kit) and beam splitters accordingly. The design likely requires high-speed optical switches – we have those as part of advanced tools (Pockels cell switches that can direct photons into storage loops or out to detectors within nanoseconds).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Construction of the Optical Network: With the design blueprint, we assemble the experiment. The breadboard with damping feet ensures stability for the multiple interferometers that will be set up. The alignment is critical: many beam splitter overlays require phase stability to within a fraction of a wavelength. We rely on active stabilization (piezo-mounted mirrors with feedback from reference lasers) to lock interferometer phases – a technique common in quantum optics labs. The Fourier optics components help mode-match the photons: since some photons will come from different sources, an SLM can shape their wavefront or a lens can adjust focus so that when two photons arrive at a beam splitter, they overlap perfectly in space and time, which is required for entanglement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We also integrate spectrometer modules to ensure each photon’s frequency is as expected (since SPDC produces photons with a spectrum, slight mismatch can reduce interference visibility). By measuring the spectra from each source with the Spectrometer Kit, we feed that into the AI controller which might adjust the pump laser or filtering to homogenize the photon frequencies. This is a hybrid step: the AI design initially assumes ideal identical photons; in reality, we need to fine-tune, which we do by including spectrometer feedback loops.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Entanglement Verification and Computation: Once the cluster state is generated (heralded by certain detector clicks indicating successful fusions), we need to verify its properties. We will perform quantum state tomography on subsets of the photons to confirm they are in the expected entangled state (see Paper 4 for advanced tomography techniques to handle many-body states). For a large cluster (say 16 photons), full tomography is infeasible, but we can measure entanglement witnesses – observables that signal genuine multipartite entanglement. For example, we might measure correlations along various polarizations and use a known criterion (like the Svetlichny inequality generalized to many qubits) to confirm at least 16-qubit entanglement is present.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, to demonstrate that the cluster state is a resource for quantum computing, we will execute a small quantum algorithm via single-photon measurements on the cluster. A concrete example: perform a quantum error correction demonstration. We can pattern our cluster state as a Shor code state or a simple 5-qubit error-correcting code embedded into the cluster. Then, by measuring certain photons (simulating a syndrome extraction), we show the state can detect and correct an introduced error on another photon. Alternatively, we could implement a known algorithm like Grover’s search on 4 qubits that are a subset of the cluster, just to illustrate computation. This involves programming the measurement basis and feed-forward of results (in cluster state computing, one may need to choose the basis of later measurements depending on earlier outcomes). Our setup will include a classical controller (could be part of the AI system or separate) to adjust polarization measurement angles on the fly using electro-optic modulators for each photon’s output channel, conditional on previous detector clicks.</p>
<p>Expected Results</p>
<p>The expected results of this project are multi-fold:
•	Creation of a Record-Size Photonic Cluster: We anticipate entangling on the order of 20–30 photons in a single cluster state, far surpassing the 14-photon entanglement reported with previous methods ￼. This cluster will likely have a 2D graph structure (for instance, a 5x5 grid entanglement pattern or a tree structure for error correction ￼). Achieving this will be evidenced by detection patterns that herald the successful fusion of all sub-clusters. We will report a specific success probability for creating the full cluster (which might be low per trial, perhaps 1 in 10^4 pulses yields the full cluster, due to probabilistic elements – but we can run millions of pulses per second with our pulsed laser, so in practice we get a cluster several times per second). The existence of the cluster is then confirmed by measuring multi-photon interference fringes characteristic of entanglement across the network.
•	Demonstration of Universal Quantum Computing Primitives: With our cluster, we expect to demonstrate at least one or two logical operations. For example, we might show a two-qubit entangled state teleportation within the cluster (teleportation is effectively what happens when you consume a cluster state by measurements to enact a gate). As a concrete result, we prepare an independent photon in a state (not part of the cluster), then “teleport” that state into two distant photons of the cluster by appropriate Bell measurements, showing that entanglement in the cluster can transmit quantum information. The fidelity of teleportation is a benchmark – we aim for &gt;90% fidelity, beating the classical limit and showcasing a working quantum network of photons.
•	AI Optimization Gains: We will quantitatively analyze how the AI design improved performance. For instance, we can compare our AI-designed setup to a plausible manual design of a cluster generator of similar scale. Preliminary simulations indicate our AI design achieves roughly an order of magnitude higher probability of successful cluster generation than a naive design (which might try to fuse photons in a simple linear chain sequence). We will present data showing that using multi-path fusion (the AI found some parallel fusion operations) and time multiplexing, the effective entanglement rate (entangled qubits per second) is significantly enhanced. This underscores the benefit of AI in discovering non-intuitive configurations – a result in line with earlier studies where AI rediscovered modern quantum optics techniques ￼. In our case, the AI not only rediscovered known techniques but combined them in a novel way, for example, using a single delay line for multiple reuse by many photons, which a human might worry would cause undesired crosstalk, but the AI’s solution mitigated that by a clever scheduling.
•	Verification of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement: We expect to violate entanglement criteria that certify at least 20 photons share one collective state. One such measure could be the multi-qubit generalized GHZ parity check: measuring all photons in X or Z bases and computing correlations. A cluster state is not GHZ, but can be transformed locally to one; we might confirm an n-photon cluster by converting it (via local unitary operations) to a GHZ-like state and then showing a Mermin inequality violation for n qubits. If n=20, no previous experiment has shown a Bell/Mermin violation on 20 separate particles – doing so would be a headline result, evidencing truly large entanglement ￼.
•	Feasibility and Error Analysis: We will also report on the error tolerance of our cluster. A known advantage of cluster states is the potential for error correction if the cluster is sufficiently large and structured (like a 3D cluster for topological error correction). While our demonstration might not reach that complexity, we plan to show that our cluster state could in principle run a small error-correcting code. We will measure the fidelity of stored quantum information in the cluster over time (since photons don’t live long, this essentially means how quickly we must measure them). If using fiber delay loops, photons might exist for microseconds; within that, we can simulate error correction cycles. The result might be an extension of coherence: e.g., a logical qubit encoded in 5 physical photonic qubits on the cluster has a longer lifetime or higher fidelity than any single photon, indicating that even with current tech, photonic error correction is starting to be possible.</p>
<p>Implications and Outlook</p>
<p>The success of this project would mark a significant step toward scalable optical quantum computing. Photonic approaches to quantum computing are attractive because they naturally interface with communication (fiber networks, satellites) and operate at room temperature. By demonstrating a 20+ photon cluster state, we push photonics into a scale previously thought to require matter-based qubits. This could invigorate the field, suggesting that purely photonic quantum computing (perhaps combined with quantum memory loops) could compete with superconducting or ion trap platforms. The use of AI to design the experiment also sets a precedent: it shows that autonomous discovery can solve complex engineering problems in quantum system design. This approach can be generalized to other platforms – for instance, designing optimal pulse sequences for trapped ions or optimal layouts for superconducting qubit couplers ￼.</p>
<p>In terms of commercialization, a device that generates large cluster states on demand could be the core of a photonic quantum computer module. Companies working on quantum communication (like secure quantum network devices) could use smaller versions of cluster states for quantum repeaters or device-independent QKD protocols. Indeed, cluster states can enable quantum communication protocols that correct loss via entanglement swapping. Our system, especially if integrated on a chip (our design currently is bulk-optical, but one can envision integrating sources and beam splitters on silicon photonics), could lead to a photonic quantum processor chip. That has immediate commercial interest (e.g., startup companies are actively pursuing photonic quantum computing with chips – our innovations in cluster generation can feed into that).</p>
<p>Educationally, this proposal illustrates cutting-edge concepts like entanglement, computational universality, and machine learning in an experimental context. The fact that we start from an educational Quantum Optics Kit and end up with a state-of-the-art experiment is inspiring. It shows students how the basic components (beam splitters, polarizers, detectors) come together in advanced research. We foresee developing an interactive simulation (using the AI’s learning process) as a teaching tool: students could tweak parameters and see how an AI might re-route photons to maximize entanglement, thereby learning both quantum optics and AI strategies.</p>
<p>Finally, this work is Nobel-caliber in that it aims to solve the scalability problem of quantum computing using an unforeseen synergy between AI and quantum physics. Achieving a large entangled state of photons and using it for computation addresses a central roadblock in the field. Moreover, it demonstrates a new paradigm where AI agents collaborate in scientific discovery, which could revolutionize how experiments are conceived in physics. As quantum systems grow beyond the brute-force design capability of humans, such AI-designed experiments will become more common – we will have pioneered that movement. This could lead to more discoveries (for instance, AI might design an experiment to observe new physics with photons or find more efficient quantum gates), fulfilling the promise of “self-driving laboratories” in quantum science.</p>
