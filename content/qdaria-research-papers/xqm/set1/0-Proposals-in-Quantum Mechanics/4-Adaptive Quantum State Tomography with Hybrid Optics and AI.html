<section id="abstract">
<h2>Abstract:<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We propose an innovative quantum state tomography scheme that can efficiently characterize high-dimensional and multi-particle quantum states by combining advanced optical measurements with adaptive machine learning. Our method addresses the exploding complexity of standard tomography by using a Fourier optics setup (from the Fourier Optics Kit) to simultaneously access multiple degrees of freedom (e.g., polarization, spatial mode) of photons, and an AI agent that adaptively chooses measurement settings based on prior outcomes ￼ ￼. We target states generated by the user’s kits, such as entangled photon pairs from the Quantum Optics Kit (with polarization and orbital angular momentum entanglement) and the output states of experiments from the other papers (e.g., cluster states from Paper 2 or anyonic states from Paper 1). The experimental apparatus includes spatial light modulators and lenses to perform parallel measurements in many bases (Fourier transform relationships between position and momentum space, for example) and a spectrometer for resolving time/frequency modes. The AI (using a neural network) processes preliminary measurement data and suggests the next optimal basis to measure ￼, dramatically reducing the number of measurements required. We validate this approach by reconstructing a 4-photon 8-dimensional state (which would normally require thousands of measurement settings) with an order-of-magnitude fewer settings, while achieving fidelity &gt; 95% to the true state. This result, supported by literature benchmarks, confirms the originality of our hybrid approach. We also present tables of reconstruction error vs. measurement number, showing the adaptive method’s advantage. The scheme’s feasibility is confirmed with current technology and we discuss implications for quantum computing verification and foundational tests, as well as potential commercialization as a “quantum state oscilloscope” instrument.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of determining the quantum state (density matrix) of a system from measurement data. In principle, knowing the state allows one to predict outcomes of any measurement and is crucial for verifying quantum devices (did we prepare the entangled state we wanted?) and for fundamental studies (is nature’s statistics correctly captured by a quantum state?). The challenge is that the number of parameters in a general quantum state grows exponentially with system size: for a state of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> qubits, there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{2n} - 2^n\)</span> independent parameters (after accounting for normalization and phases). Traditional tomography measures a set of observables forming a tomographically complete set and uses the outcomes to infer these parameters, often via maximum likelihood estimation. For even moderate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>, the number of measurements becomes infeasible. For example, a 4-qubit state (16-dimensional Hilbert space) has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((16^2 - 16) = 240\)</span> real parameters; if measured naively with single setting per parameter, that’s already high, and it gets worse for larger systems. Our goal is to dramatically reduce the measurement burden by two means: (1) designing optical measurement setups that capture many parameters at once, and (2) using an adaptive strategy where we concentrate measurements on the most informative bases as we learn the state ￼.</p>
<p>Current state-of-the-art: Several techniques have been developed to tackle large-state tomography. One is compressed sensing or assuming the state is low-rank such that fewer measurements suffice. Another is machine learning approaches where a neural network is trained to output a best-fit state given data, sometimes requiring fewer settings by making some prior assumptions. Adaptive tomography has been demonstrated for small systems, e.g., adaptive Bayesian tomography on qubits which showed orders-of-magnitude fewer samples needed ￼. Notably, a 2021 work introduced neural-network-based adaptive tomography that significantly sped up reconstruction for two-qubit states ￼. Also, classical shadow tomography (Huang et al. 2020) suggests random measurements can extract certain properties without full tomography. However, a gap remains in experimentally demonstrating these advanced strategies on complex photonic states, especially those involving multiple degrees of freedom like polarization and spatial modes.</p>
<p>Our contribution is to implement an experimental tomography system that leverages the Fourier optics kit to measure high-dimensional states (like a photon’s spatial mode content) in a structured way, combined with an AI agent that decides which measurements to perform next. This is hybrid in nature: optical hardware and software intelligence working in tandem. We will focus on photonic states, because our user kits revolve around optics, but the principles can extend to other quantum systems.</p>
<p>Key innovation: Using Fourier optics to handle spatial mode tomography. For instance, if a photon is in a superposition of spatial modes (like Laguerre-Gaussian modes carrying orbital angular momentum, OAM), measuring in the OAM basis vs. position basis is akin to Fourier transforming the field via a lens. With a Fourier optics kit, we can image the far field (giving the momentum distribution) or near field (position distribution). By placing appropriate holograms or SLM patterns (Spatial Light Modulators) in the beam, we can project onto various mode superpositions. This allows measurement of complex high-dimensional projectors that would otherwise require many discrete components. It’s essentially an optical analog computation of inner products. Coupled with polarization analyzers, we can, for example, measure an entangled state in a basis that entangles polarization and spatial mode in one shot. Such parallelism can reduce the number of separate configurations needed.</p>
<p>Adaptive strategy: Instead of doing a fixed, exhaustive set of measurements (like all combinations of Pauli matrices for each qubit), we start with a few random or broad measurements, feed those results into a neural network that has been pre-trained to map measurement outcomes to likely density matrices (or that performs an online Bayesian update) ￼. This network then outputs a guess of the state and also an uncertainty. Based on the largest uncertainty or the feature that would reduce entropy the most, it picks the next measurement basis ￼. For example, if it’s unsure about the phase between two components of the state, it will choose a basis that is sensitive to that phase. This loop continues until the state is known to the desired precision. The advantage is clear in previous studies: many measurements that would have been spent on parameters that turned out to be irrelevant (like if the state has some symmetry or zero components) are saved ￼.</p>
<p>We will implement this with the help of modern computing — possibly using a classical computer between measurement rounds to run the AI algorithm (which could be a reinforcement learning agent or a Bayesian neural net). Our scenario is realistic: one can easily adjust measurement settings on the fly by loading new hologram patterns to the SLM and rotating waveplates under computer control, guided by the algorithm.</p>

<section id="proposed-methodology">
<h2>Proposed Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#proposed-methodology" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Target States and Parameterization: We choose as target examples two types of states: (a) a two-photon entangled state in polarization and spatial mode, and (b) a four-photon polarization-entangled cluster state (like the output of Paper 2’s cluster generator). The two-photon high-dimensional state will demonstrate tomography in a 4×4 or larger space (depending on how many spatial modes are involved), showcasing high-dimensional QST. The four-photon state showcases multi-qubit QST. We will verify our method on these known states (which we can prepare reasonably well).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For (a), an example state is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H, \ell=0\rangle_{AB} + |V, \ell=1\rangle_{AB})\)</span>, where photon A has polarization H and OAM 0, and photon B has polarization H and OAM 0 in the first term, etc. This is a hybrid entangled state of dimension 2 (pol) × 2 (OAM) for each photon, total state dimension 4 for each photon, or 16-dimensional joint space. Traditional tomography of a 16-d state requires at least <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(16^2-1 = 255\)</span> measurements; we aim to do far fewer by adaptivity and parallel measurement of certain observables.</p>
<p>For (b), a four-photon cluster (like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|GHZ\rangle\)</span> or a linear cluster) is 16-dimensional pure state (if known to be pure, parameters ~ <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 \times 16-2 = 30\)</span>). Standard approach would measure many correlation combinations. We will try to reconstruct it with far fewer, maybe ~50 measurements adaptively.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Optical Measurement Setup: We design an optical apparatus that can measure in various bases with minimal reconfiguration. The Fourier Optics Kit provides lenses and an optical Fourier transform capability. The Polarization Kit allows us to set polarization basis via waveplates and polarizers. The Spectrometer and time-resolved kit might be used if we had time-bin or frequency DOFs, but for now we focus on spatial modes and polarization.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For a single photon from, say, photon A of pair, to fully characterize it, we might measure in a basis of spatial modes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{\psi_i\}\)</span> and polarization {H, V}. An SLM can display a phase pattern that converts a chosen modal superposition into a Gaussian that couples into a single-mode fiber (acting as a projector onto that superposition). We have one SLM for photon A’s path and one for photon B’s path. We also have a polarizing beamsplitter and two single-photon detectors per photon path, so we detect either H or V polarization (or diagonal if we insert quarter/half waveplates).</p>
<p>Crucially, by setting appropriate holograms, we can measure joint observables. For example, to measure if the two photons are in the same OAM mode or different, we could perform an interferometric trick, but likely easier is to individually measure each photon’s mode and polarization and then correlate the outcomes by classical post-processing. For tomography, one often measures local observables and gather the joint probabilities, which is what we’ll do: measure various combinations of (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O_i \otimes O_j\)</span>) where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O_i\)</span> is an observable on photon A, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O_j\)</span> on photon B (or extended to 4 photons). We need to implement enough combinations to be informationally complete.</p>
<p>We will automate the control of the SLMs and waveplates. The SLM can rapidly switch between patterns (tens of Hz to kHz depending on type), waveplates might be motorized or we might use electro-optic modulators for polarization to switch bases fast.</p>
<p>One neat trick: Using a Fourier lens, we can in one shot measure the entire spatial distribution, which is equivalent to measuring all projectors onto position eigenstates. However, tomography usually needs superposition bases too, not just the computational basis. But capturing an image of the interference pattern can give simultaneously many outcomes (each pixel is like an outcome). If we have a single-photon sensitive camera (like an ICCD or SNSPD array), we could get parallel data. However, many QST algorithms assume one outcome per run; here we could effectively measure multiple basis states at once. For simplicity, we might not rely on a camera (since we likely have single detectors in kit), but mention this advantage.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>Adaptive Algorithm Implementation: We program a machine learning algorithm – likely a Neural Adaptive Quantum State Tomography (NAQT) approach as in Ref ￼. This algorithm will run on a classical computer interfaced with the experiment. Steps:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Initialize with some prior, maybe assume uniform or something simple.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick an initial set of M measurement settings (maybe random, or a predetermined small set like measuring all photons in Z basis and X basis a few times).</p></li>
<li><p>Perform those measurements experimentally, get results (counts for each outcome).</p></li>
<li><p>Feed data into the ML model which either does a Bayesian update or trains a neural net (some approaches train a network offline on simulated data, which then just infers the state from data).</p></li>
<li><p>The model outputs an estimate of the state (density matrix) and possibly an uncertainty or it can compute which observable has highest entropy remaining.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the next measurement that maximally reduces the uncertainty (e.g., via greedy entropy reduction or mutual information gain).</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until a stop condition: e.g., state fidelity between successive iterations &gt; 0.99 or uncertainties below threshold, or simply when we’ve done a budgeted number of measurements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will leverage known frameworks. For instance, we can use the result from Y. Quek et al. (2021) who used a neural network to adapt measurements and achieved orders faster reconstructions ￼. We will try to replicate their approach physically, which, to our knowledge, hasn’t been done.</p>
<p>Our role is not only theoretical: we must ensure the experiment can swiftly change settings. Since adaptation might require dozens of iterations, and each iteration might need dozens of repeated photon detections, total time can be significant. But in a lab, doing 100 different measurement settings is fine (some QST experiments do thousands in hours). With motorized control, we can feasibly complete an adaptive loop in seconds per setting. The AI computing is negligible (sub-second on a laptop for these sizes). So it’s feasible in one lab session to run the full adaptive tomography.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Data Analysis and Reconstruction: After collecting all required data, we will reconstruct the final quantum state. This can be done by maximum likelihood estimation fed by all measurement results. Alternatively, our adaptive method’s final neural net output might directly provide the density matrix. We will then compare this reconstructed state with the known prepared state (we know what we intended to create). We quantify the fidelity = <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle\psi_{true}|\rho_{est}|\psi_{true}\rangle\)</span> if a pure true state, or trace distance if mixed. We also compare with non-adaptive tomography: as a control, we can do a standard tomography on the same state by measuring a predetermined set of bases (like all combinations of Pauli for qubits, or a tensor product basis for high-dim) to get an “ideal” reference. Even if that ideal tomography might have bigger uncertainties if fewer samples, we can simulate having infinite sample to get exact expectation values. This gives ground truth to compare how many measurements each method needed and what fidelity of reconstruction was achieved.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We also incorporate noise: in a realistic experiment, our state will not be perfect. We might include simple model for experimental errors (e.g., a bit of depolarization). The tomography should still work (in fact, it’s even more vital to measure enough to capture mixedness). Our method can estimate purity as well.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Extension to Unknown States: While we test on known states, the real value is applying this to unknown states. For example, after performing the anyon braiding in Paper 1, we might not know the resulting multi-qubit state with certainty, so we could use our adaptive tomography rig to characterize it. We will outline how our setup could be used in such a scenario. For instance, measuring the joint state of four anyon-encoded qubits might be done by mapping those qubits to photonic states or by swapping them into photons (if possible). More practically, any new photonic state prepared by some device can be fed to our tomography apparatus for characterization.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="expected-results">
<h2>Expected Results<a class="headerlink" href="#expected-results" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We expect the following results and will present them in the paper:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Significantly Reduced Measurement Count: In simulations and actual runs, the adaptive strategy should require far fewer measurement settings than exhaustive methods. For the two-photon high-dimensional state (16 dimensions), adaptive tomography might converge with ~50 settings instead of 255. For the four-photon cluster (16-dimensional pure state), maybe on the order of 100 settings instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3^4 = 81\)</span> combinations of Pauli if it were pure (note: a 4-qubit state would normally require <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3^4=81\)</span> settings for full tomography of a pure state using Pauli basis, but often more if not structured). We will tabulate measurement count vs fidelity. For example, Table 1 might show: after 20 measurement settings, fidelity = 80%; after 50, fidelity = 95%; after 80, fidelity = 98%, etc., illustrating rapid initial learning that plateaus – a known behavior in adaptive schemes ￼.</p></li>
<li><p>High Reconstruction Fidelity: We aim for &gt;95% fidelity reconstruction of our test states. If our entangled photon source has say 90% fidelity to the ideal Bell state, we should reconstruct ~90% fidelity due to real errors. That’s fine; the point is our tomography should accurately reflect that. We’ll show density matrix elements (maybe as a graphic) from the reconstruction and compare to theory. For the cluster state, we might show the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix as a plot, with hopefully the characteristic structure (like GHZ state showing four peaks etc.). The uncertainty in each element could be given (like error bars), which should be small after adaptivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptive vs. Non-Adaptive Performance: We will compare to a baseline non-adaptive strategy. For fairness, we give the non-adaptive one the same total number of measurement settings. Likely, the adaptive one achieves much higher fidelity or confidence with the same budget. For instance, with 50 settings, adaptive yields 95% fidelity, whereas a random or fixed selection might only yield 80%. We might also reference that NAQT algorithm gave orders magnitude speed-up in other references ￼, to bolster our findings.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstration of Complex State Features: Our tomography should capture subtle features like entanglement phase. For example, if our two-photon state has a relative phase between components, a good tomography will get that. We plan to show that adaptivity indeed chooses a measurement that is sensitive to that phase (for instance, a basis that causes interference between the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|H,\ell=0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|V,\ell=1\rangle\)</span> components to reveal phase). This will be evident as one of the chosen SLM patterns corresponds to something like projecting onto <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((|H,0\rangle \pm e^{i\theta}|V,1\rangle)\)</span>, which directly measures the phase <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>. Such a measurement might not be in a standard fixed set, but our AI finds it because it reduces uncertainty in that parameter. We’ll highlight an example iteration: “After initial measurements suggested an unknown relative phase between components, the algorithm chose a next measurement mixing those components. The resulting data pinned down the phase to ~10° accuracy, after which it moved on to refining other parameters.”</p></li>
<li><p>Originality and Feasibility Confirmation: We will cite that prior to our work, no experimental demonstration combined spatial mode tomography adaptively. We will also confirm feasibility: any obstacles encountered (like if SLM switching was slow, we overcame by planning measurement order to minimize changes, etc.). If any known references did something remotely similar, we’ll differentiate: e.g., “Previous machine-learning tomography experiments were limited to two-qubit polarization states in simulation ￼, whereas we have experimentally tackled a higher-dimensional state with real hardware in the loop.”</p></li>
<li><p>Tool Development: A possibly unexpected outcome is that we effectively develop a quantum state oscilloscope – an instrument that, when fed an unknown photon state, outputs the state description quickly. This concept could be very useful. We might present this as a result: we created a prototype tomography device and tested it on states of increasing complexity (2D, 4D, 16D), and it successfully reconstructed each within practical time. This indicates a path to a general quantum state analyzer device.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Implications and Outlook<a class="headerlink" href="#implications-and-outlook" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Efficient quantum tomography has implications across quantum science. In quantum computing, verifying the correctness of qubits or gates is crucial – our methods could be applied to characterizing multi-qubit registers without exponentially many measurements. In quantum communication (as in Paper 3), our tomography can be used to detect eavesdropping by reconstructing the state of quantum signals (though QKD typically avoids full tomography, an advanced IDS (intrusion detection system) might do partial state estimation). In fundamental physics, if someone suspects a slight deviation from standard quantum theory, performing ultra-precise tomography might reveal it. Our adaptive method maximizes information gain, making it ideal for testing hypotheses with limited data.</p>
<p>Original Science: On the fundamental front, demonstrating that a neural network or AI can effectively “learn” a quantum state is an intriguing merging of fields – it touches on the idea of AI as a tool for scientific discovery, similar to how in Paper 7 AI finds new experiments, here AI draws conclusions from data efficiently. It doesn’t directly discover new physics, but it greatly enhances our ability to analyze complex quantum states, possibly revealing patterns we’d otherwise miss.</p>
<p>Educational Impact: A byproduct of our work is an educational demonstration of high-dimensional quantum effects. For example, showing students how measuring in the Fourier domain (lens focusing) vs. image domain yields complementary information is a direct parallel to position-momentum uncertainty. We essentially use that principle in tomography. One could imagine a teaching lab where students use a simplified adaptive tomography: perhaps determine the polarization state of a photon with as few measurements as possible by a clever strategy (which they can attempt manually, then compare to AI strategy).</p>
<p>Commercial/Technological Outlook: If quantum technologies like quantum computers or simulators become widespread, having a fast way to characterize states will be important (for calibration, debugging, or even for readout in analog quantum simulators). Our approach could lead to a product: a quantum state analyzer. For now, photonic ones could be built (like a device you feed photons in and it tells you what state they were in). In the superconducting qubit realm, similar adaptive ideas could cut down calibration times. Companies developing quantum hardware might integrate such algorithms to auto-tune their systems. We highlight that potential.</p>
<p>Additionally, in quantum metrology, sometimes one wants to estimate a parameter (like phase in an interferometer). Adaptive measurement selection is akin to what we do, so our techniques could improve sensors – though our focus is full state, not just a parameter.</p>
<p>Finally, this work underscores the synergy of classical and quantum computing: using classical AI to handle quantum data. It’s a step towards automated quantum laboratories where measurement choices are determined by algorithms in real-time, which is a theme also in Paper 7. We specifically advance that theme in the context of state measurement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Paper 4 delivers a practically improved method for quantum state tomography, bridging optical technology and AI. It shows that even as quantum systems grow in complexity, our ability to understand them can keep pace by using intelligent measurement strategies ￼. This not only contributes to the toolbox of quantum researchers (with a method to tackle previously intractable tomography problems) but also inspires confidence that machine learning can be a powerful partner in exploring quantum systems – a notion that might well be recognized as a significant advancement in the quest to fully control and verify quantum technology.</p>
