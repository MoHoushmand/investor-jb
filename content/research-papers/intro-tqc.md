# Introduction to Topological Quantum Computing Research

This section provides an overview of QDaria's research papers and efforts related to Topological Quantum Computing (TQC). Our work in this area focuses on the theoretical foundations, material discovery, and potential applications of TQC, particularly leveraging non-Abelian anyons for fault-tolerant quantum computation.
