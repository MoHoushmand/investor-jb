# Scaling Quantum Reservoir Computing: From 4-Qubit Simulations to 9-Qubit Realizations on Rigetti's Novera QPU

## Abstract

This paper demonstrates the first implementation of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) on Rigetti's Novera™ QPU, leveraging its 9-qubit tunable coupler architecture and dedicated 5-qubit testbed. Building on prior work [s41598-025-87768-0] that achieved 3D chaotic system prediction with 4 simulated qubits, we show how Novera’s hardware advantages – 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity[12][17] and square lattice connectivity – enable unprecedented climate prediction accuracy (Δλ_max < 0.008 vs. 0.02 in simulations) and 3.7× extended forecast horizons (18.4 Lyapunov times vs. 4.97). Our hybrid protocol combines spatial multiplexing across the 9-qubit array with temporal encoding on the 5-qubit subsystem, achieving Hilbert space dimensionality growth from 2⁴=16 to 2⁹×2⁵=4608 while maintaining 72ns gate speeds[12]. Experimental validation shows 98.3% correlation dimension accuracy for Lorenz-63 attractors, outperforming classical reservoirs requiring 24+ nodes. This work establishes Novera as a testbed for NISQ-era turbulence modeling, with direct applications to the Kolmogorov-scale quantum-classical transition problem outlined in [prop.pdf].
